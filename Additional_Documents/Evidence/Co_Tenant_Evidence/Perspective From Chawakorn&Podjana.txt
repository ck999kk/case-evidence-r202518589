Podjana Tienmon — Perspective
I am a co‑tenant at Unit 1803. I share the tenancy with Chawakorn but I occupy a different bedroom. The mould and water‑damage problem arose in his bedroom, not mine. My room was not the source of the issue, and I was not responsible for the underlying problem.

When the agent issued a notice to vacate, I felt I was being swept into a process I did not cause. I had complied with my obligations and looked after my room and shared spaces. Being asked to leave on the basis of an “unsafe premises” notice—without particulars showing a whole‑premises danger—felt unfair to me as a co‑tenant whose bedroom was unaffected.

English is not my first language, and navigating technical emails and formal steps has been stressful. I depend on stable housing to support my daily life, and sudden eviction threatens my safety and wellbeing. I am willing to cooperate fully with access for repairs and any reasonable program to fix the damage. What I am asking for is simple: do not punish me for a problem that was not in my room and that can be managed through a structured remediation plan. I want repairs done properly, with clear scheduling, and without an eviction that would harm me despite my lack of involvement in the cause.

Chawakorn Kamnuansil — Perspective
I am an international student and the co‑tenant in the bedroom where the water‑damage and mould were found. I first reported the issue after noticing a strong smell and visible wall problems. Contractors later inspected and proposed a remediation plan that involved containment of my bedroom, removal of affected materials, decontamination, drying for several days, and follow‑up verification. They indicated my bedroom would be unusable during the works and suggested temporary accommodation for that period. They also noted I could return between stages of the works, which implies the rest of the unit could remain habitable while the bedroom is sealed and treated.

Throughout this period, I sought to do things correctly: I raised the issue, cooperated with inspection, and looked for a safe, practical solution. Receiving a notice to vacate framed as “unsafe premises,” without clear particulars about whole‑premises unfitness, felt wrong—especially when a contained remediation option was already described. I want the remediation to proceed safely and promptly, with proper access and scheduling, and with temporary accommodation for the period my room is sealed. I am not trying to obstruct repairs; I am asking for a fair process that targets the affected area rather than evicting both tenants on short notice. My goal is safe completion of the works and to continue my studies and tenancy without being forced out for a problem that can be managed through the plan already described.
