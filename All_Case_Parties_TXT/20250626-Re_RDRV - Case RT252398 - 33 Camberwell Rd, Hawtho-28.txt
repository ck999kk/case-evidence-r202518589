Hi Matthew,


Thank you for your email.
I have spoken with them yesterday morning and they have advised that due 
to their tight schedule, they will have to look into their booking and 
let us know when is the next available date.

The contractor advised that the next available date should be within the 
next 6-7 business days.


Since I haven’t received any confirmation, I have just sent another 
email to the OC and the contractor, asking them to provide a date & time.

I will let you know once I have heard back from them.

Thank you.

Good afternoon Johnson

Can you please confirm whether you are able to confirm a time that 
trades will be able to reattend the property. Could you please confirm 
this by close of business today.

If not I will need to progress this matter to a hearing due to 
timeframes required to list urgent repair applications.

If an agreement can be reached regarding a timeframe to resolve the 
repair issue this matter can be struck out with a right of 
reinstatement. I have included the renters in this email for reference.

Regards,

*Matthew T.**
