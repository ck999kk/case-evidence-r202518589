Hi Chawakorn,

Good evening and hope you're both doing well.

I’m following up on my previous email regarding the compensation from 
the OC.

Please know that I’m here to assist and help explore the best possible 
options for you.

At the end of the day, our shared goal is to have the issue resolved as 
quickly and smoothly as possible.

I completely understand your concerns about staying in the property 
during the repair work.

When FIXD inspected the property back in May, the initial estimate for 
the job duration was over 7 – 10 days.

However, due to the delays, the condition might have been deteriorated. 
Hence, FIXD is unable to provide a timeframe of the work.

As I have not yet received a confirmed response from the OC regarding 
the $800 compensation offer, I would like to outline some options for 
you to consider:

 1. Seek temporary accommodation during the works, and submit a
    reimbursement claim to the OC, who is ultimately responsible for the
    leak. While this is a valid option, I must note that we cannot
    guarantee the outcome of their approval.
 2. Early lease termination without penalty. If you feel the property
    will be uninhabitable during the repairs and would prefer not to
    take the risk of seeking compensation from the OC, the rental
    provider is willing to allow you to break the fixed-term lease early
    with no penalties.
 3. If you would like to further escalate this, you can have the OC
    joined as a party to residential tenancy application at VCAT

Please let us know which option you would prefer, or if there’s anything 
else we can do to support you.

Thank you again, and wishing you a pleasant evening.

Kind Regards,

Hi Chawakorn,

Thank you for your email.

I would like to seek clarification on one thing, which I haven’t 
received a certain answer yet.

I can see that there is a $800 compensation, offered by the OC.

Is that compensation amount meant to be compensating the inconvenience 
during the work?

If so, I believe that is the reason why the OC didn’t offer an 
alternative accommodation for this job.

If no, can you please forward the email of you rejecting that offer?

Thank you Chawakorn.

Hi Johnson,

Resending this—just to be sure it doesn’t get /lost/ in whichever 
account you feel like using today.

Consider it a polite note that swapping signatures and email headers 
doesn’t erase what’s actually happened here, or who is responsible.

Regards,
Chawakorn

    Dear Johnson,

    For clarity and to avoid further confusion:

    *Where, precisely, are we expected to sleep while industrial dryers
    operate in our only bedroom?
    *
    For how many days? What specific arrangements have you made to
    ensure we are not left without habitable space?

    Let’s be absolutely clear: I never confirmed anything. There is no
    message in which I agreed—because none exists.

    It is remarkable that after over two months of delay, the only
    certainty you can offer is the threat of charges if access is
    denied—yet you remain unable to answer the most basic question about
    where your tenants will live.

    *If Sylvia chose to claim “confirmation” on my behalf, perhaps the
    cost of this entire situation belongs with her, not me.
    *
    I look forward to seeing whether you can provide an actual plan
    rather than more excuses.

            To Johnson,

            This email is a formal response to the multiple, legally
            defective 'Notice to Renter' documents issued by Areal
            Property. It outlines your non-compliance and contains a
            final demand for action.

            Let us first establish the facts, based entirely on your own
            actions and documentation:

             1. *Your Notices Are Invalid:*You deliberately marked "NO"
                on your own forms, formally declaring no details were
                attached. This renders them defective under the RTA.
             2. *You Have Fabricated Evidence:*You have repeatedly
                relied on a non-existent "tenant-confirmation" to
                support your false narrative.
             3. *Abdication of Professional Duty:*Your notice directs me
                to seek help from Consumer Affairs Victoria. This is a
                formal admission of your failure to perform your duties
                as an agent, attempting to outsource your
                responsibilities to me.

            After 70+ days of this conduct, the direct result of your
            failures is that one simple, fundamental question remains
            unanswered. The proposed work is in our only bedroom.
            Sylvia's unprofessional suggestion to "stay at a friend's
            place" is not a solution.

            Therefore, a singular, fundamental question requires your
            immediate attention:

            *Where, precisely, are my roommate and I supposed to live
            while our bedroom is a work site?*

            To be clear, any refusal of entry based on an unworkable or
            unreasonable plan—similar to the unhelpful suggestions you
            have provided in the past—will not be considered a breach on
            my part. The responsibility to provide a viable, respectful
            solution rests entirely with you. *Consider this carefully*.

            I require your clear, written plan for suitable temporary
            accommodation by *5:00 PM tomorrow, 4 July 2025.*

            If you fail to provide this plan by the deadline, I will,
            without further notice, file an urgent application with VCAT
            and a formal complaint with Consumer Affairs Victoria. The
            complaint will detail the entire pattern of conduct outlined
            in this email, including your issuance of defective legal
            documents, fabrication of evidence, and abdication of
            professional duties.

            Your own documents will form the basis of my submissions.
