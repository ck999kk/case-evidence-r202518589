Hi Sylvia,


Thanks for your reply. Here’s an update on the wall — although the water 
has dried, there is still a visible stain and surface warping, as shown 
in the attached photo.


I’ve done my best to manage it temporarily using Gumption, but this is 
clearly not a long-term solution and shouldn’t fall under the tenant’s 
responsibility.


The wall is still visibly damaged and the room remains unsuitable for 
normal use. I need to know when someone will be sent to inspect and 
repair the affected area. This needs to be addressed properly, not just 
acknowledged.


Also, for record-keeping purposes, all communication regarding this 
matter must be done via email, as phone calls cannot be documented as 
evidence if needed.


I expect a response with a clear action plan and timeline.


Best regards,

Chawakorn

    Hi Chawakorn,____

    __ __

    Thank you for your email, and I do apologise for the lack of updates
    — I understand your concerns and appreciate your continued patience.____

    __ __

    The plumber who attended the unit last Wednesday was arranged by the
    Owner’s Corporation to address the leak from the hot water system.
    We are currently waiting on their formal report to confirm that the
    issue has been fully resolved.____

    __ __

    In the meantime, could you please let me know if there has been any
    further water ingress or signs of dampness since their visit? This
    will help ensure there are no ongoing issues.____

    __ __

    Once we receive confirmation that the source of the leak is no
    longer active, we will arrange for quotations to repair the internal
    damage, including the wall and potentially affected carpet and
    underlay.____

    __ __

    I understand how frustrating this situation is and will continue to
    follow up with the relevant parties to ensure the matter is
    addressed appropriately.____

    Hi Sylvia,____

    __ __

    It’s been over a week since the plumber attended, and I’ve yet to
    see any update or progress on the condition of my unit. I had
    already sent photos clearly showing wall damage — fixing the leak
    alone doesn’t resolve everything.____

    __ __

    This unit is carpeted, and the leak went on for days. It’s only
    logical to assume the carpet and underlay have been affected too.
    Does it really make sense to think the issue ends with the hot water
    pipe?____

    __ __

    Also, why has there been complete silence? It’s not even during a
    public holiday period this time, and yet I’m still left waiting with
    no information. Is the delay coming from the building manager, or is
    the owner just not interested in maintaining their own property?____

    __ __

    I’ve been patient long enough. Please advise what steps are being
    taken regarding both the wall and the carpet, and whether an
    inspection will be arranged.____

    __ __

    Regards,____

    Chawakorn____
