Required (Unit 1803)

Dear Sylvia,


I hope you are doing well.


I’m writing again to follow up on the urgent water leakage issue in my 
unit (1803, 243 Franklin Street), which I first reported prior to the 
Easter holiday.


At the time, I was advised that this would be treated as a priority and 
was also provided with a contact list for emergency tradespeople. In 
accordance with that advice, I reached out to Flood Response as listed. 
Unfortunately, they replied stating that they were closed on Easter 
Monday and unable to attend. I’ve attached a screenshot of their message 
for reference.


Since then, I have not received any updates or confirmation regarding 
the next steps, even though the holiday period has now ended. Meanwhile, 
the situation has continued to worsen.


Attached are the most recent photos taken today, clearly showing the 
ceiling stains spreading further, severe wall swelling, and visible 
water marks continuing to develop. More critically, as the flooring in 
my room is carpeted, water has now begun to soak into the carpet, 
creating both dampness and a persistent musty odour.


This is no longer just a structural concern — it now directly affects my 
personal living conditions and health. The continued moisture increases 
the risk of mould developing beneath the carpet, which could pose 
serious health risks and result in more extensive damage if not 
addressed immediately.


I’ve followed every step requested and have been as patient as possible. 
However, at this stage, I must insist on urgent action. I trust that I 
will not be held responsible for any resulting damages, especially given 
that I have reported the issue early and complied with all procedures.


Please confirm when a professional will attend the property to inspect 
and begin repairs. I’d truly appreciate your prompt attention and 
resolution to this matter.


Also, if possible, could you please update my contact details to ensure 
you’re using my current number: 0449 962 645.

For the previous issue regarding the bed, I suspect there may have been 
an attempt to reach me on an outdated number.


Kind regards,

Chawakorn Kamnuansil
