Dear Matthew,

Thank you for your email regarding Case RT252398 at 33 Camberwell Rd, 
Hawthorn East.

I just want to share some information from my side to help you 
understand the situation more clearly. I'm an international student 
living in this unit, and I’m not very familiar with all the repair or 
legal processes in Melbourne, but I’m really trying to follow everything 
the right way.

Recently I heard that a contractor came, but I didn’t receive any clear 
message or schedule about what was going to happen. I didn’t know if 
they were coming just to check or to actually repair the problem. I also 
wasn’t told if I needed to leave the room or prepare anything. Because I 
live in the area that needs repair, this kind of information is really 
important for me to get ready properly.

To try my best, I stayed up the whole night before working on documents 
and preparing everything I thought might be useful for this case. I 
finished around 5 AM. I was trying to be responsible and respectful of 
the process. Unfortunately, I was so tired that I accidentally fell 
asleep in the morning and didn’t hear anything when the contractor came. 
It wasn’t on purpose, and I really didn’t mean to miss them.

I never refused access. I just didn’t get clear communication about the 
visit and couldn’t prepare for it properly. I still really want the 
repair to be done and I’m happy to reschedule, as long as I know in 
advance what will happen and what I need to do.

Please continue with the case. The problem hasn’t been fixed yet and I’m 
hoping we can move forward.

Kind regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil
