Hi Chawakorn,

We're writing to inform you about the upcoming Routine Inspection of the 
property. This inspection is an essential step for us to understand the 
current condition of the property, identify any necessary maintenance, 
and plan for future works.


*Inspection Date & Time:*
The inspection will take place on* 1/05/2025 between *9.00 am and 5:30 
pm**. We understand that it's a broad timeframe, but we assure you that 
we will do our best to minimize any inconvenience.

*What We'll Look At:*
   During our inspection, our primary focus will be on:

 1. The overall condition of the home
 2. Lawns (ensuring they're mowed)
 3. Garden beds (checking they're weed-free)
 4. Bathroom (for any mould presence)
 5. Shower tiles & grout (Clean & free of mould & soap scum)
 6. Exhaust fans (cleanliness of covers)
 7. Oven & rangehood filters (surfaces are clean & free of grease)


*Access & Personal Belongings:*
For ease of access, we'll be using our spare keys. If there are any 
personal belongings or valuable items you'd prefer to secure, especially 
if you won't be present, kindly do so ahead of our visit.

*Photos for Reporting:*
We will take photographs of the property during our inspection. Rest 
assured, our cameras are designed to automatically blur any faces, 
including those in photographs, to prioritize and protect your privacy. 
If there are any personal items you'd prefer not to be captured, please 
move them out of sight for the duration of the inspection.

*Maintenance Requests:*
If there's any maintenance or concerns you'd like us to be aware of, we 
request you to provide this in writing.

We appreciate your cooperation in this matter. Should you have any
