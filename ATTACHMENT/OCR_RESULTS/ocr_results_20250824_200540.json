      "text_content": "Residential Tenancies Act 1997\nSection 91ZZO(a)\n(Regulation 37)\nNOTICE TO VACATE TO RENTER OF RENTED PREMISES\nINFORMATION FOR RENTERS\n1.This is a notice to vacate. It tells you that the residential rental provider (rental provider) wants you to\nmove out by a certain date. You can find details of this date in clause 10 \"Termination date\" below.\n2. Challenging this notice - You may be able to challenge this Notice at the Victorian Civil and Administrative\nTribunal (VCAT). Reasons to challenge a notice include:\n• you believe you were given this notice due to unlawful discrimination or because you tried to exercise\nyour rights as a renter; or\n• you believe it was not given to you properly; or\n• you disagree with the reason given or the information in the form is incorrect or incomplete; or\n• you have experienced family or personal violence and this caused the behavior listed in the notice to\nvacate. In this case, you should apply to VCAT within 30 days after the notice has been given.\nSpecific timeframes may apply to certain reasons to challenge a notice. You may also challenge the validity of\nthe notice if the rental provider applies to VCAT for a possession order.\nYou should seek advice if you are considering challenging a notice to vacate.\n3. Unpaid Rent\nIf you received a notice because you have not paid your rent -\n• If you pay all of the unpaid rent on or before the termination date in the notice, this notice has no effect.\n• However, this does not apply if you have been given four earlier notices to vacate for rent arrears within\na twelve-month period that starts either on the date your agreement commenced or the anniversary of\nthat date.\n• You can find out more about this type of notice to vacate on the Consumer Affairs Victoria website.\n4. Possession orders and warrants - Rental providers must give you the appropriate notice to vacate before they\napply to VCAT for a possession order.\nIf you do not vacate on the date stated in the notice, the rental provider may apply to VCAT asking for an order\nrequiring you to leave (a possession order). VCAT will notify you of a hearing date that you can attend. You are\nencouraged to attend the hearing.\nAt the hearing, VCAT decides whether the rental provider was entitled to give you a notice to vacate. VCAT will\nmake a possession order if it is satisfied that it is reasonable and proportionate to do so. VCAT may consider\nwhether the notice to vacate was given in response to the act of a person who has subjected you to family or\npersonal violence. It may also consider whether you can comply with a payment plan for any rental arrears, if\napplicable.\nVCAT will decide if you must leave the property and on what date that should occur. You may ask for more time\nin the property if you will be in hardship. Rental providers cannot personally use force to remove you if you\nrefuse to leave the property. Only Victoria Police can carry out a forcible eviction, and only when they are acting\non a VCAT order (a warrant for possession).\n5.Ending the residential rental agreement earlier - In some cases, you may be able to end the residential rental\nagreement (rental agreement) earlier than the termination date in the notice to vacate, if the notice is given for\none of the following reasons:\nRepairs or renovations; demolition; change of use of premises; occupation by the rental provider or their family;\nthe premises are to be sold; the premises are required for a public purpose; the renter no longer meets the\neligibility criteria; or in the case of a fixed term rental agreement, to specify a termination date that is on or after\nthe date of the end of the initial fixed term of the agreement.\nTo notify the rental provider, use a Notice of intention to vacate form and provide at least 14 days notice.\n6. Seeking advice - If you think you have grounds to challenge a notice to vacate at VCAT you should seek\nadvice immediately by contacting one of the community legal organisations listed on the Consumer Affairs\nVictoria website. For further information visit the renting section of the Consumer Affairs Victoria website at\nconsumer.vic.gov.au/renting or call 1300 558 181 .\nNOTICE TO VACATE\n7.

On 23 May 2025, contractor FIXD Trade Group inspected and confirmed the room is\nunsafe. Urgent mould remediation is required, including sealing the room, chemical treatment, and drying using\nindustrial equipment. Drying is expected to take 7 days, followed by reinstatement of plaster and painting, with\nthe full process taking up to 14 days.\nThe property will be unsafe and unsuitable to occupy during this time due to noise, equipment use, and health\nrisks. Despite multiple written requests, the renter has refused access, preventing critical repairs.\nThis Notice to Vacate is issued to allow urgent works and restore the property to a habitable standard. The\nrenter is required to vacate by 14 July 2025.\nIn many cases this notice must be accompanied by documentary evidence. For information on documentary\nevidence go to www.consumer.vic.gov.au/ntv\nIs documentary evidence attached? Yes\nPlease provide details of the evidence attached:\nMessage Thread Franklin Street (PDF)\nThis includes a detailed email thread between the managing agent, contractor (FIXD Trade Group), and the\nOwners Corporation.

Hence, FIXD is unable to provide a timeframe of the work.\nAs | have not yet received a confirmed response from the OC regarding the $800 compensation offer, | would like to outline some options for you to consider:\n1. Seek temporary accommodation during the works, and submit a reimbursement claim to the OC, who is ultimately responsible for the leak. While this is a valid option, | must note that we cannot guarantee the outcome of their approval.\n2. Early lease termination without penalty. If you feel the property will be uninhabitable during the repairs and would prefer not to take the risk of seeking compensation from the OC, the rental provider is willing to allow you to break the fixed-term lease\nearly with no penalties.\n3. If you would like to further escalate this, you can have the OC joined as a party to residential tenancy application at VCAT\nPlease let us know which option you would prefer, or if there’s anything else we can do to support you.\nThank you again, and wishing you a pleasant evening.\nKind Regards,\nJohnson Tan\nb Senior Relationship Manager - Coverage\noF\n\\ 73 0420 846 041\njohnson.tan@areal.com.au\n03 9818 8991\nfe\n33 Camberwell Road Hawthorn East VIC 3123\nwww.areal.com.au\nay ay a,\nrep ) 4 s a § %,\n— FF LF Ee",

Address of rented premises\n1803/243 Franklin Street, MELBOURNE VIC 3000\n8. Renter's Details (include the name of each renter who is a party to the residential rental agreement)\nChawakorn Kamnuansil\nPodjana Tienmon\n9.

Termination Date\nThe termination date must allow for:\n• the minimum notice required under the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 (the Act); and\n• the proposed method of delivery and the date the renter is expected to receive the notice.\nThe minimum number of days’ notice required under the Act is 0.\nI request that you vacate on or before the following termination date: 14 July 2025\nNote: If you want to challenge this notice you should seek legal advice as soon as possible.\n11. Reason for notice\n•The rental provider must select the relevant reason, section number and the minimum notice\nrequired under the act.\n•The rental provider must also explain why the notice has been given. It is not enough to quote\njust from the Act or from the reasons on the information sheet; this must be accompanied by\nspecific details.\n•VCAT may find a notice to vacate invalid where it does not provide enough details or is not\naccompanied by the required documentary evidence.\nI am giving you this notice for the following reason:\nSection 91ZL Unsafe premises\nThe premises are unfit for human habitation or have been destroyed totally, or to such an extent as to be\nrendered unsafe.\nA roof leak from common property caused water to enter the bedroom, resulting in swollen plaster, bubbling\npaint, and visible mould. On 23 May 2025, contractor FIXD Trade Group inspected and confirmed the room is\nunsafe. Urgent mould remediation is required, including sealing the room, chemical treatment, and drying using\nindustrial equipment. Drying is expected to take 7 days, followed by reinstatement of plaster and painting, with\nthe full process taking up to 14 days.\nThe property will be unsafe and unsuitable to occupy during this time due to noise, equipment use, and health\nrisks. Despite multiple written requests, the renter has refused access, preventing critical repairs.\nThis Notice to Vacate is issued to allow urgent works and restore the property to a habitable standard. The\nrenter is required to vacate by 14 July 2025.\nIn many cases this notice must be accompanied by documentary evidence. For information on documentary\nevidence go to www.consumer.vic.gov.au/ntv\nIs documentary evidence attached? Yes\nPlease provide details of the evidence attached:\nMessage Thread Franklin Street (PDF)\nThis includes a detailed email thread between the managing agent, contractor (FIXD Trade Group), and the\nOwners Corporation. It provides:\nConfirmation of mould presence and safety concerns\nScope of remediation works (drying, sealing, chemical treatment)\nEstimated timeline for drying (7 days) plus reinstatement\nStatement that the property is unsafe and inaccessible during the works\nContractor recommendation for the tenant to vacate\n12. Delivery of this notice\n• The notice period begins the day after the renter is estimated to receive this notice.\n• If sending by post, the rental provider must allow for the delivery time in calculating the proposed\ntermination date.\n• If sending by registered post, the rental provider should keep evidence of the mail delivery method used\nto send this notice.\nThis notice was sent on 11 July 2025\nThis notice will be delivered\nby email (if consent has been provided by the renter)\nRenter’s email address: bewty980219@gmail.com\nck.chawakorn@gmail.com\n13.

However ,\nthe length of drying time may vary depending on external factors such as weather conditions and moisture content.\nFIXD is not responsible for delays in drying due to uncontrollable factors. Monitoring will be conducted daily , and any\nnecessary adjustments/cost variations will be communicated promptly . FIXD will not be held responsible for any pre-\nexisting conditions discovered during the course of remediation, including but not limited to structural defects, non-\ncompliant installations, or prior water damage. Any discoveries will be communicated to the insured, and additional\nworks may be required outside the scope of this project.\nWe cannot provide a timeline as per your request due to the existing site constraints and nature of the damages. \nPlease note, once drying equipment is on-site, it is charged per day . If access is not provided as required by our team,\nextra charges may be applicable to the renters for not providing access. \n \nHi Chawakorn,\nSince no access was given on 24 June 2025, the contractor has sent us the attached invoice.\nPlease advise whether you would like to pay them directly .\nOtherwise, the OC will settle with FIXD and on-charge the amount to Lot 1803A, and the rental provider will be\nseeking reimbursement from you.\nPlease advise, thank you.\n \nFrom:  Johnson Tan\n[Quoted text hidden]\n[Quoted text hidden]\n5 attachments\nNotice of entry 9 July 2025.pdf\n10K\nNotice of entry 8 July 2025.pdf\n10K\nNotice of entry 7 July 2025.pdf\n10K\nAusPost lodgement.pdf\n104K\nNotice of entry lable.pdf\n136K",

The applicants have filed an application under section 91ZZS of the Residential Tenancies Act 1997\nchallenging the validity of a notice to vacate.\n2. The notice to vacate in question was given to the renter under section 91ZL of the Residential \nTenancies Act 1997.\n3. Section 91ZZS of the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 specifies that a renter may apply to challenge \nthe validity of a notice to vacate given under section 91ZX , 91ZY, 91ZZ, 91ZZA, 91ZZB or 91ZZC. \nIt does not allow a renter to challenge the validity of a notice to vacate given under section 91ZL.\n4. Pursuant to section 75 of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 1998 , the Tribunal has \nformed the view on the material before it, that the application is misconceived.\n5. The renters cannot preemptively challenge the notice to vacate. However, the renters can still \nchallenge the validity of the notice to vacate under section 91ZZI of the A ct if the residential \nrental provider applies for a possession order on the basis of the 91ZL notice to vacate \nissued on 11 July 2025 .\n6. The Tribunal notes that if the parties can agree on an arrangement for the renters to move \nout for about 14 days, the repairs could be completed and the renters could return to the \npremises . \nVCAT orders :\n1. The application is struck out with a right to apply for reinstatement.\nNote: If the applicants apply for reinstatement they must provide details of why the strike out order is \nopposed, including a response to the findings made by the Tribunal above.\nF.

It tells you that the residential rental provider (rental provider) wants you to\nmove out by a certain date. You can find details of this date in clause 10 \"Termination date\" below.\n2. Challenging this notice - You may be able to challenge this Notice at the Victorian Civil and Administrative\nTribunal (VCAT). Reasons to challenge a notice include:\n• you believe you were given this notice due to unlawful discrimination or because you tried to exercise\nyour rights as a renter; or\n• you believe it was not given to you properly; or\n• you disagree with the reason given or the information in the form is incorrect or incomplete; or\n• you have experienced family or personal violence and this caused the behavior listed in the notice to\nvacate. In this case, you should apply to VCAT within 30 days after the notice has been given.\nSpecific timeframes may apply to certain reasons to challenge a notice. You may also challenge the validity of\nthe notice if the rental provider applies to VCAT for a possession order.\nYou should seek advice if you are considering challenging a notice to vacate.\n3. Unpaid Rent\nIf you received a notice because you have not paid your rent -\n• If you pay all of the unpaid rent on or before the termination date in the notice, this notice has no effect.\n• However, this does not apply if you have been given four earlier notices to vacate for rent arrears within\na twelve-month period that starts either on the date your agreement commenced or the anniversary of\nthat date.\n• You can find out more about this type of notice to vacate on the Consumer Affairs Victoria website.\n4. Possession orders and warrants - Rental providers must give you the appropriate notice to vacate before they\napply to VCAT for a possession order.\nIf you do not vacate on the date stated in the notice, the rental provider may apply to VCAT asking for an order\nrequiring you to leave (a possession order). VCAT will notify you of a hearing date that you can attend. You are\nencouraged to attend the hearing.\nAt the hearing, VCAT decides whether the rental provider was entitled to give you a notice to vacate. VCAT will\nmake a possession order if it is satisfied that it is reasonable and proportionate to do so. VCAT may consider\nwhether the notice to vacate was given in response to the act of a person who has subjected you to family or\npersonal violence. It may also consider whether you can comply with a payment plan for any rental arrears, if\napplicable.\nVCAT will decide if you must leave the property and on what date that should occur. You may ask for more time\nin the property if you will be in hardship. Rental providers cannot personally use force to remove you if you\nrefuse to leave the property. Only Victoria Police can carry out a forcible eviction, and only when they are acting\non a VCAT order (a warrant for possession).\n5.Ending the residential rental agreement earlier - In some cases, you may be able to end the residential rental\nagreement (rental agreement) earlier than the termination date in the notice to vacate, if the notice is given for\none of the following reasons:\nRepairs or renovations; demolition; change of use of premises; occupation by the rental provider or their family;\nthe premises are to be sold; the premises are required for a public purpose; the renter no longer meets the\neligibility criteria; or in the case of a fixed term rental agreement, to specify a termination date that is on or after\nthe date of the end of the initial fixed term of the agreement.\nTo notify the rental provider, use a Notice of intention to vacate form and provide at least 14 days notice.\n6. Seeking advice - If you think you have grounds to challenge a notice to vacate at VCAT you should seek\nadvice immediately by contacting one of the community legal organisations listed on the Consumer Affairs\nVictoria website. For further information visit the renting section of the Consumer Affairs Victoria website at\nconsumer.vic.gov.au/renting or call 1300 558 181 .\nNOTICE TO VACATE\n7.

Reason for notice\n•The rental provider must select the relevant reason, section number and the minimum notice\nrequired under the act.\n•The rental provider must also explain why the notice has been given. It is not enough to quote\njust from the Act or from the reasons on the information sheet; this must be accompanied by\nspecific details.\n•VCAT may find a notice to vacate invalid where it does not provide enough details or is not\naccompanied by the required documentary evidence.\nI am giving you this notice for the following reason:\nSection 91ZL Unsafe premises\nThe premises are unfit for human habitation or have been destroyed totally, or to such an extent as to be\nrendered unsafe.\nA roof leak from common property caused water to enter the bedroom, resulting in swollen plaster, bubbling\npaint, and visible mould. On 23 May 2025, contractor FIXD Trade Group inspected and confirmed the room is\nunsafe. Urgent mould remediation is required, including sealing the room, chemical treatment, and drying using\nindustrial equipment. Drying is expected to take 7 days, followed by reinstatement of plaster and painting, with\nthe full process taking up to 14 days.\nThe property will be unsafe and unsuitable to occupy during this time due to noise, equipment use, and health\nrisks. Despite multiple written requests, the renter has refused access, preventing critical repairs.\nThis Notice to Vacate is issued to allow urgent works and restore the property to a habitable standard. The\nrenter is required to vacate by 14 July 2025.\nIn many cases this notice must be accompanied by documentary evidence.

This is now our second attempt to proceed with the repairs. To clarify, all\nrelevant parties – including the OC, FIXD, our agency as the managing agent, and the rental provider are fully\ncommitted to commencing and completing the necessary repairs as promptly as possible.\nPage 2 of 4\nWe are more than willing to provide any further information the renter may reasonably request to facilitate\ncooperation. However, we respectfully request that VCAT take into account that we are NOT the party\nimpeding progress.\nHi Chawakorn,\nPlease refer to below response in blue , as I have communicated with FIXD prior to this email.\nI will get the remaining requested details from FIXD, but I can’t guarantee that they will reply within 24 hours.\nGiven that coordinating this repair requires the involvement of multiple parties and significant resources, your\ncooperation is not only appreciated but essential to ensure the work can proceed without further delay.\nThank you.\nFrom: Chawakorn Kamnuansil < ck.chawakorn@gmail.com >\nSent: Tuesday, 1 July 2025 3:08 PM\nTo:Johnson Tan < johnson.tan@areal.com.au >\nCc:CSV-VCAT-Cases (CSV) < Cases@courts.vic.gov.au >; Areal Property MPM\n<mpm@email.propertyme.com >;bewty980219@gmail.com\nSubject: Re: RDRV - Case RT252398 - 33 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn East, VIC, 3123\nDear Johnson,\nYour three Section-86 notices, lodged by registered post on 27 June 2025, seek entry at\n08:00 AM on 7, 8 and 9 July—only **12 days’** lead time—and leave the “Details attached” box\nunchecked. Entry therefore remains conditional.\nSEND WITHIN 24 HOURS\n1. Contractor legal name, licence number & 24-hour mobile – Pending FIXD’s reply\n2. Day-by-day work scope (rooms, tasks, time estimates) for the full 7-day schedule The first stage of the\nrepair involves reducing the moisture levels in the affected bedroom, as outlined in the Notice of Entry. During\nthis drying process, the contractor will require daily access to the room in order to monitor and record\nmoisture readings. At this stage, they are unable to provide specific time estimates for this phase, as the\nduration will depend on how quickly acceptable moisture levels are reached. Once the area has dried\nsufficiently, they will proceed with the necessary repair work. Please note that because the contractor has not\nyet assessed the current site conditions in full, they are unable to provide a definitive timeline or scope for the\nrepairs at this time.\n3. Risk statement – water / power interruptions & noise levels - Pending FIXD’s reply\n4. Public-liability / PI insurance certificate - Pending FIXD’s reply\n5. “Tax invoice.pdf” **and** the alleged “tenant-confirmation” screenshot FIXD has been engaged by the\nOwners Corporation, as the source of the leak originates from a common area. The OC will cover the cost of\nthe repairs once the work is completed. At this stage, FIXD is unable to provide a quote, as they have not yet\nbeen able to assess the current site conditions in detail. Could you please clarify what you mean by a “tenant-\nconfirmation screenshot”?\n6. Daily-rate schedule for drying equipment **plus** written assurance that no\n“no-access” surcharge will be levied without a Tribunal order As previously mentioned, FIXD is the\ncontractor appointed by the Owners Corporation (OC), and the OC will be covering the cost of the scheduled\nworks. Could you please clarify the relevance of the “daily-rate schedule for drying equipment”? There will be\nno additional charges incurred, provided FIXD is granted access in accordance with the Notice of Entry and\nPage 3 of 4\nthere are no delays caused by restricted access or obstruction to the repair process.\n_No bundle → No entry → Call-out fee remains fictional._\n**Provisional window (if items 1-6 arrive):** **Wed 9 Jul 2025, 15 : 30 – 19 : 00 AEST**\n**Retaliatory warning** Your 27 Jun 15 : 09 email (“…deduct from your bond…”) breaches\ns 264 RTA. Any repeat—or any attempt to impose daily drying fees without prior disclosure—\nwill trigger my application for penalty units and costs.\n**Non-confirmation notice** Until items 1-6 are supplied, this email does **not** constitute\nconsent.\nKey verbatim excerpts for easy reference:\n• *Exh A – 16 Jun 04 : 37 (tenant)* “any update … I’ll reply before 12 : 00 …”\n• *Exh B – 16 Jun 11 : 52 (agent)* “Thanks so much … **for confirming** …”\n• *Exh C – 23 Jun 14 : 35 (agent)* “remediation work … 24 Jun 08 : 30 … provide access …”\n• *Exh D – 27 Jun 15 : 09 (agent)* “**we will deduct it from your bond**.”\nYour own notices concede the job “might be extended subject to the length of the drying\nprocess” yet provide no timeline or cost caps.

Hence, FIXD is unable to provide a\ntimeframe of the work.\nAs I have not yet received a confirmed response from the OC regarding the $800 compensation offer, I would\nlike to outline some options for you to consider:\n1.Seek temporary accommodation during the works, and submit a reimbursement claim to the OC, who is\nultimately responsible for the leak. While this is a valid option, I must note that we cannot guarantee the\noutcome of their approval.\n2.Early lease termination without penalty. If you feel the property will be uninhabitable during the repairs\nand would prefer not to take the risk of seeking compensation from the OC, the rental provider is willing to\nallow you to break the fixed-term lease early with no penalties.\n3.If you would like to further escalate this, you can have the OC joined as a party to residential tenancy\napplication at VCAT\nPlease let us know which option you would prefer, or if there’s anything else we can do to support you.\nThank you again, and wishing you a pleasant evening.\nFrom: Johnson Tan\nSent: Monday, 7 July 2025 11:07 AM\nTo:Chawakorn Kamnuansil < ck.chawakorn@gmail.com >; Areal Property MPM\n<mpm@email.propertyme.com >\nCc:Cases@courts.vic.gov.au ;bewty980219@gmail.com ; Sylvia Hao < sylvia.hao@areal.com.au >\nSubject: RE: RDRV - Case RT252398 - 33 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn East, VIC, 3123\nHi Chawakorn,\nThank you for your email.\nI would like to seek clarification on one thing, which I haven’t received a certain answer yet.\nI can see that there is a $800 compensation, offered by the OC.\nIs that compensation amount meant to be compensating the inconvenience during the work?\nIf so, I believe that is the reason why the OC didn’t offer an alternative accommodation for this job.\nIf no, can you please forward the email of you rejecting that offer?\nThank you Chawakorn.\nFrom: Chawakorn Kamnuansil < ck.chawakorn@gmail.com >\nSent: Friday, 4 July 2025 11:37 PM\nTo:Areal Property MPM < mpm@email.propertyme.com >; Johnson Tan < johnson.tan@areal.com.au >\nCc:Cases@courts.vic.gov.au ;bewty980219@gmail.com ; Sylvia Hao < sylvia.hao@areal.com.au >\nSubject: Re: RDRV - Case RT252398 - 33 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn East, VIC, 3123\nHi Johnson,\nPage 3 of 4\nResending this—just to be sure it doesn’t get lost in whichever account you feel like using today.\nConsider it a polite note that swapping signatures and email headers doesn’t erase what’s actually happened here, or who is responsible.\nRegards,\nChawakorn\nOn Fri, Jul 4, 2025 at 10:32 PM Chawakorn Kamnuansil < ck.chawakorn@gmail.com > wrote:\nPage 4 of 4\n33 Camberwell Rd\nHawthorn East VIC 3123\nhttps://www.areal.com.au/\nsandy.sun@areal.com.au\nABN: 40645223212\nLicence: 087207L\nReport created: 11/08/2025Message Thread - Follow-up – Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved\nRepairs (Unit 1803)\nDetail\nProperty: 1803/243 Franklin Street, Melbourne VIC 3000\nDate: 6/06/2025 Last message on: 24/06/2025\nFirst response on: 6/06/2025 Minutes to respond: 200 minutes\nStatus: Completed Task Type: Task\nSent to: Sylvia Hao Sent on: 27/06/2025\nMessages\nSubject: Follow-up – Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved Repairs (Unit 1803)\nCreated on: 6/06/2025 Message type: Received Email\nFrom: Chawakorn Kamnuansil (ck.chawakorn@gmail.com)\nDear Sylvia,\nI am writing with the intent of resolving this matter constructively and without escalation, if possible.\nOver the past two months, I have reported the water damage issue multiple times in good faith, cooperated with your office, and done my best to\nremain in the property despite the difficulties. I am not trying to be confrontational; I simply need a clear and reasonable outcome, supported by\nappropriate action and communication.\nPlease find attached:\n1.A formal demand letter outlining my request for rent compensation, a firm repair timeline, and confirmation of non-liability – based on my rights\nunder the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 (VIC).\n2.A supporting tenant statement summarising the verbal communication with your office around 2–3 June 2025, including the temporary\naccommodation proposal and its impractical conditions.\nIf a fair and written resolution is not reached within five (5) business days, I will have no choice but to initiate proceedings through VCAT.

Could you kindly confirm whether works can commence on\nThursday, 6 June 2025, or let us know your earliest availability to provide access?\nWe will continue to keep you updated as we receive further information from the Owners Corporation.\nKind regards,\nSylvia Hao\nRelationship Manager\nM0420 675 561\nP03 9818 8991\nA33 Camberwell Road, Hawthorn East VIC 3123\nOn 6/06/2025 1:21 AM, Chawakorn Kamnuansil <ck.chawakorn@gmail.com> wrote:\nSubject: Re: Follow-up – Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved Repairs (Unit 1803)\nCreated on: 6/06/2025 Message type: Received Email\nFrom: Chawakorn Kamnuansil (ck.chawakorn@gmail.com)\nDear Sylvia,\nThank you for your response dated Friday, 6 June 2025 at 11:50am.\nAs the primary resident of the property who has lived through weeks of unresolved water damage, I must reiterate that no one is more eager than I\nam to see the situation resolved quickly and properly. However, I am currently unable to provide consent for any repair work to begin.\nFirstly, your email referred to repairs commencing on \"Thursday, 6 June\"a date which had already passed at the time of your message. This\ninconsistency is not just confusing; it is logistically impossible and calls into question the seriousness of the repair planning. Such unclear and last-\nminute communication cannot form the basis for valid consent.\nPage 2 of 13\nSecondly, I must emphasise that I cannot authorise access until the following points are clearly confirmed in writing:\n1. A definitive and specific repair timeline, including projected completion date.\n2. Whether temporary relocation will be required, and if so, what arrangements or compensation are being offered.\n3. Your position on my formal request for rent reduction and confirmation of non-liability, which remain outstanding.\n4. Acknowledgment of the impact on my co-tenant, who is also named in the lease agreement, and who will equally be affected by noise and\naccessibility issues related to the drying equipment.\nIt is my responsibility to ensure that any agreement made does not inadvertently waive our legal rights or create further hardship. I must act\ncautiously, especially as the installation of industrial drying equipment operating 24/7 poses real disturbancessomething your office acknowledged in\nour previous phone call.\nIf I were to consent now without these matters resolved in writing, it could later be used to suggest that I accepted all resulting conditions, which I\nabsolutely do not.\nTherefore, I will only provide access once I receive formal written confirmation addressing all points above. Until then, I consider it unreasonable to\ndemand a commitment from me, especially under these unclear and one-sided circumstances.\nAs noted in my formal demand, if a resolution is not reached within five (5) calendar daysincluding weekendsI will proceed to file an application with\nVCAT.\nKind regards,\nChawakorn Kamnuansil\nck.chawakorn@gmail.com\nOn Fri, 6 Jun 2025 at 11:50, Sylvia Hao - Areal Property Hawthorn (MPM) < MPM@email.propertyme.com > wrote:\nSubject: Re: Follow-up – Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved Repairs (Unit 1803)\nCreated on: 10/06/2025 Message type: Sent Email\nTo: Chawakorn Kamnuansil, (ck.chawakorn@gmail.com, bewty980219@gmail.com)\nDear Chawakorn,\nThank you for your email and for clearly outlining your concerns.

So I hope that\ncontext can be considered as part of your team’s preparation before we meet. It would really help if everything could be brought or explained clearly\nduring the discussion, so we don’t go in circles.\nTo keep things moving forward, I’d like to propose an in-person meeting at your office on Thursday, 12 June at 10:30 AM. I’ll be bringing a support\nperson with me as well. Nothing formal — just someone to help me navigate things clearly.\nIf this time doesn’t work for your team, please let me know by 9:00 AM Thursday. If I don’t hear back by then, I’ll assume the meeting can’t go ahead\nas suggested and will take the next steps from there.\nThank you again — I’m still hopeful we can bring this to a clear and fair resolution.\nKind regards,\nChawakorn Kamnuansil\nOn Tue, 10 Jun 2025 at 16:19, Sylvia Hao - Areal Property Hawthorn (MPM) < MPM@email.propertyme.com > wrote:\nSubject: Fwd: Follow-up – Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved Repairs (Unit 1803)\nCreated on: 12/06/2025 Message type: Sent Email\nTo: (michael.zhang@areal.com.au)\nPage 7 of 13\nSylvia Hao\nRelationship Manager\nM0420 675 561\nP03 9818 8991\nA33 Camberwell Road, Hawthorn East VIC 3123\nOn 11/06/2025 6:45 PM, Chawakorn Kamnuansil <ck.chawakorn@gmail.com> wrote:\nSubject: Re: Follow-up – Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved Repairs (Unit 1803)\nCreated on: 12/06/2025 Message type: Sent Email\nTo: (ck.chawakorn@gmail.com)\nDear Chawakorn,\nThank you for your thoughtful response and for your continued openness to resolving this matter collaboratively.\nWe understand the importance of your questions regarding the proposed rent adjustment, repair timeline, and related concerns.

And honestly, I’m relieved to hear from someone new, because I don’t feel that Sylvia Hao ever fully understood what\nI’ve been trying to say from the start.\nHappy holiday to Sylvia — I hope she’s having a relaxing break. I wish I could take one too under the current circumstances.\nI kindly ask you to take a moment to review my past emails. At no point did I confirm that I agreed to the works or gave consent to proceed. In fact,\nI’ve repeatedly asked Sylvia for proper information and clarification, which I never received. The only thing I said was that I might be out of touch —\nwhich I clearly explained was because I needed a break from all this due to how much stress it had caused me. And now, after several days of\nsilence, I suddenly receive a reminder that the works are happening tomorrow?\nI have no idea what’s going to happen to me tomorrow.\nYou’re asking me to provide access for something I was never truly consulted on. I was not given 14 days’ notice. And more importantly — where do\nyou actually expect me to stay? I just paid $2,825 in rent. I have no money for a second place. I can’t share a bedroom with my co-tenant. And no one\nfrom your office, including Sylvia, has ever addressed that properly.\nIf this is the agency’s internal policy — to carry out major internal works while offering no accommodation or practical alternatives to the tenant — then\nplease confirm that to me clearly. It would actually be helpful for me to have that confirmed, because I have now submitted this matter to VCAT and\nam preparing to provide a complete record of what’s happened.\nAgain, I am not refusing access. I am simply asking a question that no one has answered: where am I supposed to stay?\nPage 11 of 13\nAlso, please do not attempt to contact me by phone. I will not answer any calls. All communication must be in writing by email, as phone calls cannot\nbe recorded or documented for evidence purposes.\nRegards,\nChawakorn Kamnuansil\nOn Mon, 23 Jun 2025 at 14:35, Johnson Tan - Areal Property Hawthorn (MPM) < MPM@email.propertyme.com > wrote:\nSubject: Re: Follow-up – Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved Repairs (Unit 1803)\nCreated on: 23/06/2025 Message type: Sent Email\nTo: Chawakorn Kamnuansil (ck.chawakorn@gmail.com)\nHi Chawakorn,\nThank you for your reply. I want to start by sincerely apologising for the inconvenience and frustration this ongoing issue has caused you. I truly\nunderstand how disruptive this must be, and I appreciate your continued patience throughout.\nAfter reviewing the communication trail, I want to clarify that the source of the leak originates from a common area of the building, which falls under\nthe Owners Corporation's (OC) responsibility. As a result, all scheduling and repair works need to be coordinated through them. Unfortunately, this\nhas contributed to the delays, and I understand how frustrating that can be.\nTo address your first question: Sylvia did send an email on 18 June 2025 to both you and Podjana once the OC confirmed the appointment details.\nI’ve attached a screenshot of that email for your reference. It’s possible it was missed, but I’m glad to hear that you’ll be able to provide access\ntomorrow.\nRegarding alternative accommodation, it was my understanding that the agreed $800 compensation was intended to help offset those costs. If I’ve\nmisunderstood or missed anything, please do let me know—there’s been a lot of emails, and I want to ensure nothing important is overlooked. The\namount will be set as rent credit once the repair is commenced.\nAgain, I truly empathise with your situation. From what I’ve seen, Sylvia has been doing her utmost to keep communication flowing between all parties\ninvolved—yourself, the rental provider, the OC, and their plumber. Unfortunately, her ability to act is limited when the responsible party is not as\nresponsive as we would hope.\nPlease rest assured that we will continue to follow up closely and advocate for this to be resolved as quickly as possible.\nJohnson Tan\nSenior Relationship Manager\nM0420 846041 Ejohnson.tan@areal.com.au P039818 8991 A33Camberwell Road Hawthorn\nEast VIC 3123\nOn 23/06/2025 3:38 PM, Chawakorn Kamnuansil <ck.chawakorn@gmail.com> wrote:\nSubject: Re: Follow-up – Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved Repairs (Unit 1803)\nCreated on: 24/06/2025 Message type: Sent Email\nTo: (ck.chawakorn@gmail.com)\nHi Chawakon,\nPage 12 of 13\nI hope you're both safe and well.\nI’ve just been informed by the contractor arranged by the Owners Corporation that they were unable to carry out the scheduled repair work this\nmorning due to an access issue.

Water damage continues to impact habitability of bedroom.\nUnsafe or insecure fault or damage in the property: including?pests, mould or \ndamp?caused by or related to the building structure:\nOngoing mold growth and damp conditions in bedroom creating health hazards. Structural \nwall damage from water ingress compromises safety. Persistent musty odors and poor air \nquality documented in medical certificate from Era Health dated 23 June 2025. Bedroom \nremains uninhabitable due to safety and health concerns from unresolved water damage.\nSteps taken to resolve the issue: \nWater damage was first reported on 16 April 2025. Property management was transferred \nfrom Hilary Ho to Sylvia Hao on the same day without addressing the urgent issue. Multiple \nfollow-up emails were sent on 20 April, 23 April, and throughout May 2025. A plumber \nidentified the source as a hot water system leak on 28 April 2025, but complete repairs \nincluding wall restoration, mold remediation, and carpet replacement have not been \ncompleted. The bedroom remains unusable for over 2 months. Repairs are now scheduled \nfor 24 June 2025 at 8:30 AM with no alternative accommodation provided.\nHave you raised the issue(s) in writing with your rental provider or real estate agent:\nYes \n     \nHow do you want this dispute to be resolved:\n1. Immediate provision of alternative accommodation during repair period\n2. Compensation for rent paid while bedroom was unusable (approximately $1,400-1,500 \nper month for 2+ months)\n3. Complete restoration of property to habitable condition\n4. Protection orders preventing retaliation\n5. Assurance that all future repairs will be completed within reasonable timeframes\n6. Compensation for stress, inconvenience, and health impacts as documented by medical \ncertificate\nI want VCAT to redirect my rent payments into a Rent Special Account until repairs \nare completed\nSupporting documents\nRental agreement: Residential Rental Agreement [2024-12-23] \n1803_243 Franklin St  Melbourne VIC \n3000.pdf\nEvidence: 3.0 Rent receipts.jpeg, 1.0Email Evidence \nSummary.pdf, 0.0 Cover Message.pdf, \nOrders Requested.pdf, Emergency \nStatement.pdf, 1.3MERGE GMAIL.pdf, \n1.2Sumary.pdf, 5.0 Doctor's letter from Era \nHealth.pdf, 1.1Email Evidence - Unit 1803 \nRental Dispute.pdf\nAcknowledgment\nBy submitting this form, I understand and acknowledge that:  \n✓To the best of my knowledge, all information provided in this application is true and \ncorrect \n✓An RDRV application is an application to VCAT\n✓It is an offence under section 136 of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Act \n1998 to knowingly give false or misleading information \nFull name of person completing this form\nChawakorn Kamnuansil\nRental Dispute Resolution Victoria (RDRV) is an appropriate dispute resolution and case \nmanagement service provided by VCAT.

      "text_content": "Dear Sylvia,\nThank you for your response dated Friday, 6 June 2025 at 11:50am.\nAs the primary resident of the property who has lived through weeks of unresolved water damage, I must reiterate that no one is more eager than I am to see the situation resolved quickly and properly. However, I am currently unable to provide consent for any repair work to begin.\nFirstly, your email referred to repairs commencing on \"Thursday, 6 June\"a date which had already passed at the time of your message. This inconsistency is not just confusing; it is logistically impossible and calls into question the seriousness of the repair planning. Such unclear and last-minute communication cannot form the basis for valid consent.\nSecondly, I must emphasise that I cannot authorise access until the following points are clearly confirmed in writing:\n1. A definitive and specific repair timeline, including projected completion date.\n2. Whether temporary relocation will be required, and if so, what arrangements or compensation are being offered.\n3. Your position on my formal request for rent reduction and confirmation of non-liability, which remain outstanding.\n4. Acknowledgment of the impact on my co-tenant, who is also named in the lease agreement, and who will equally be affected by noise and accessibility issues related to the drying equipment.\nIt is my responsibility to ensure that any agreement made does not inadvertently waive our legal rights or create further hardship. I must act cautiously, especially as the installation of industrial drying equipment operating 24/7 poses real disturbancessomething your office acknowledged in our previous phone call.\nIf I were to consent now without these matters resolved in writing, it could later be used to suggest that I accepted all resulting conditions, which I absolutely do not.\nTherefore, I will only provide access once I receive formal written confirmation addressing all points above. Until then, I consider it unreasonable to demand a commitment from me, especially under these unclear and one-sided circumstances.\nAs noted in my formal demand, if a resolution is not reached within five (5) calendar daysincluding weekendsI will proceed to file an application with VCAT.\nKind regards,\nChawakorn Kamnuansil\nck.chawakorn@gmail.com",

      "text_content": "Subject: Without Prejudice - Formal Demand for Remedial Action and Rent Compensation\nDear Sylvia,\nWithout prejudice, I write to you in good faith with the intent to resolve this matter amicably, without\nescalation to proceedings under the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 (VIC).\nAs previously notified in writing on multiple occasions, the severe water damage affecting the\nbedroom in Unit 1803 has rendered that part of the premises functionally unusable. This has\nsubstantially interfered with my ability to enjoy the premises peacefully, as protected under s.67 of\nthe Act.\nAccordingly, I make the following formal demand to be addressed without further delay:\n1. Rectification Works:\nA binding written commitment specifying commencement and completion dates for all necessary\nrepairs, including plaster replacement, carpet remediation, and mould treatment where applicable.\n2. Rent Compensation (30%):\nI request a rent reduction of 30% commencing from 15 April 2025 until the affected bedroom is fully\nrestored and safe for normal use. This percentage is based on the fact that 1 out of 2 bedrooms (i.e.\n50% of the private quarters) has been rendered unusable for essential residential functions due to\nwater damage, odour, and potential health hazards from prolonged dampness.\nIn line with sections 207(1)(c) and 210 of the Act, the Tribunal has the discretion to order rent\nreduction where part of the premises is unfit for occupation, regardless of whether the rental\nprovider is at fault. The 30% requested is proportional, reasonable, and evidence-based.\n3. Tenant Liability:\nA written confirmation that I bear no responsibility for any of the costs associated with rectification\nworks, as the damage has originated from common building infrastructure, which falls under the\nresponsibility of the Owners Corporation.\nIf all of the above items are confirmed in writing within five (5) business days, I am prepared to\nconsider the matter fully resolved and will continue the tenancy in good faith.\nFailing this, I reserve my right to initiate proceedings before VCAT under section 452 of the Act,\nseeking urgent repairs and compensation for loss of amenity and breach of statutory duties.\nAll future correspondence regarding this matter must be in writing.\nSincerely,\nChawakorn Kamnuansil",

      "text_content": "Tenant Statement of Verbal Communications and Delayed Repairs\nI, Chawakorn Kamnuansil, tenant of Unit 1803 at 243 Franklin Street, Melbourne VIC, provide this\nstatement in relation to a phone call I received from the managing agent (Areal Property) around 2-3\nJune 2025, and the ongoing failure to rectify serious water damage in my unit.\n1. During the call, I was informed that a dehumidifier would be installed in the damaged bedroom,\nand that it would emit continuous noise and operate 24/7. I was advised that it would be better for\nme and my roommate to temporarily vacate the property.\n2. I was asked whether I could stay with nearby friends or relatives. I replied that I could not and\nwould not, because it is not my responsibility to resolve a crisis created by agency inaction. I also\nnoted that the agency had not provided any alternative accommodation options.\n3. The agency stated that if I were to seek temporary accommodation, it would only be reimbursed if\nthe cost did not exceed the current rent ($2,825/month). This is impractical-my roommate and I are\nnot in a personal relationship and cannot share a single room. Finding two separate rooms for a\nshort-term stay in Melbourne under $700/week is not realistic.\n4. I acknowledged that the landlord had offered temporary accommodation at a residence in Mount\nWaverley, but I declined. My life and work are based in the city, and relocation would severely\nimpact my routine. I asked if other options existed. The agent replied that the \"final option\" would be\nfor me to terminate the lease early.\n5. I made it clear that I would not terminate the lease. I have taken exceptional care of the property. I\nclean regularly, report issues promptly, and had no part in causing this damage. The water intrusion\nwas first reported in mid-April. Had repairs been actioned swiftly, the situation would not have\nescalated to the current level.\n6. I lived through the consequences-damp smells, wall stains, an unusable bedroom-without any\nreal assistance. I feared undertaking repairs myself in case I became liable. I used air purifiers and\ncandles daily just to remain inside the apartment.\n7. Two months later, no significant progress has been made. I am now being pressured with\nunsuitable options. I respectfully ask why no urgency was shown when I first raised this matter. Had\naction been taken earlier, extensive damage could have been avoided.\nThis statement is true to the best of my knowledge and made in good faith.\nSigned,  \nChawakorn Kamnuansil  \nDate: 6 June 2025",

The applicants have filed an application under section 91ZZS of the Residential Tenancies Act 1997\nchallenging the validity of a notice to vacate.\n2. The notice to vacate in question was given to the renter under section 91ZL of the Residential \nTenancies Act 1997.\n3. Section 91ZZS of the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 specifies that a renter may apply to challenge \nthe validity of a notice to vacate given under section 91ZX , 91ZY, 91ZZ, 91ZZA, 91ZZB or 91ZZC. \nIt does not allow a renter to challenge the validity of a notice to vacate given under section 91ZL.\n4. Pursuant to section 75 of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 1998 , the Tribunal has \nformed the view on the material before it, that the application is misconceived.\n5. The renters cannot preemptively challenge the notice to vacate. However, the renters can still \nchallenge the validity of the notice to vacate under section 91ZZI of the A ct if the residential \nrental provider applies for a possession order on the basis of the 91ZL notice to vacate \nissued on 11 July 2025 .\n6. The Tribunal notes that if the parties can agree on an arrangement for the renters to move \nout for about 14 days, the repairs could be completed and the renters could return to the \npremises . \nVCAT orders :\n1. The application is struck out with a right to apply for reinstatement.\nNote: If the applicants apply for reinstatement they must provide details of why the strike out order is \nopposed, including a response to the findings made by the Tribunal above.\nF.

      "text_content": "Residential Tenancies Act 1997\nSection 91ZZO(a)\n(Regulation 37)\nNOTICE TO VACATE TO RENTER OF RENTED PREMISES\nINFORMATION FOR RENTERS\n1.This is a notice to vacate. It tells you that the residential rental provider (rental provider) wants you to\nmove out by a certain date. You can find details of this date in clause 10 \"Termination date\" below.\n2. Challenging this notice - You may be able to challenge this Notice at the Victorian Civil and Administrative\nTribunal (VCAT). Reasons to challenge a notice include:\n• you believe you were given this notice due to unlawful discrimination or because you tried to exercise\nyour rights as a renter; or\n• you believe it was not given to you properly; or\n• you disagree with the reason given or the information in the form is incorrect or incomplete; or\n• you have experienced family or personal violence and this caused the behavior listed in the notice to\nvacate. In this case, you should apply to VCAT within 30 days after the notice has been given.\nSpecific timeframes may apply to certain reasons to challenge a notice. You may also challenge the validity of\nthe notice if the rental provider applies to VCAT for a possession order.\nYou should seek advice if you are considering challenging a notice to vacate.\n3. Unpaid Rent\nIf you received a notice because you have not paid your rent -\n• If you pay all of the unpaid rent on or before the termination date in the notice, this notice has no effect.\n• However, this does not apply if you have been given four earlier notices to vacate for rent arrears within\na twelve-month period that starts either on the date your agreement commenced or the anniversary of\nthat date.\n• You can find out more about this type of notice to vacate on the Consumer Affairs Victoria website.\n4. Possession orders and warrants - Rental providers must give you the appropriate notice to vacate before they\napply to VCAT for a possession order.\nIf you do not vacate on the date stated in the notice, the rental provider may apply to VCAT asking for an order\nrequiring you to leave (a possession order).

      "text_content": "Residential Tenancies Act 1997\nSection 91ZZO(a)\n(Regulation 37)\nNOTICE TO VACATE TO RENTER OF RENTED PREMISES\nINFORMATION FOR RENTERS\n1.This is a notice to vacate. It tells you that the residential rental provider (rental provider) wants you to\nmove out by a certain date. You can find details of this date in clause 10 \"Termination date\" below.\n2. Challenging this notice - You may be able to challenge this Notice at the Victorian Civil and Administrative\nTribunal (VCAT). Reasons to challenge a notice include:\n• you believe you were given this notice due to unlawful discrimination or because you tried to exercise\nyour rights as a renter; or\n• you believe it was not given to you properly; or\n• you disagree with the reason given or the information in the form is incorrect or incomplete; or\n• you have experienced family or personal violence and this caused the behavior listed in the notice to\nvacate. In this case, you should apply to VCAT within 30 days after the notice has been given.\nSpecific timeframes may apply to certain reasons to challenge a notice. You may also challenge the validity of\nthe notice if the rental provider applies to VCAT for a possession order.\nYou should seek advice if you are considering challenging a notice to vacate.\n3. Unpaid Rent\nIf you received a notice because you have not paid your rent -\n• If you pay all of the unpaid rent on or before the termination date in the notice, this notice has no effect.\n• However, this does not apply if you have been given four earlier notices to vacate for rent arrears within\na twelve-month period that starts either on the date your agreement commenced or the anniversary of\nthat date.\n• You can find out more about this type of notice to vacate on the Consumer Affairs Victoria website.\n4. Possession orders and warrants - Rental providers must give you the appropriate notice to vacate before they\napply to VCAT for a possession order.\nIf you do not vacate on the date stated in the notice, the rental provider may apply to VCAT asking for an order\nrequiring you to leave (a possession order). VCAT will notify you of a hearing date that you can attend. You are\nencouraged to attend the hearing.\nAt the hearing, VCAT decides whether the rental provider was entitled to give you a notice to vacate. VCAT will\nmake a possession order if it is satisfied that it is reasonable and proportionate to do so. VCAT may consider\nwhether the notice to vacate was given in response to the act of a person who has subjected you to family or\npersonal violence. It may also consider whether you can comply with a payment plan for any rental arrears, if\napplicable.\nVCAT will decide if you must leave the property and on what date that should occur. You may ask for more time\nin the property if you will be in hardship. Rental providers cannot personally use force to remove you if you\nrefuse to leave the property. Only Victoria Police can carry out a forcible eviction, and only when they are acting\non a VCAT order (a warrant for possession).\n5.Ending the residential rental agreement earlier - In some cases, you may be able to end the residential rental\nagreement (rental agreement) earlier than the termination date in the notice to vacate, if the notice is given for\none of the following reasons:\nRepairs or renovations; demolition; change of use of premises; occupation by the rental provider or their family;\nthe premises are to be sold; the premises are required for a public purpose; the renter no longer meets the\neligibility criteria; or in the case of a fixed term rental agreement, to specify a termination date that is on or after\nthe date of the end of the initial fixed term of the agreement.\nTo notify the rental provider, use a Notice of intention to vacate form and provide at least 14 days notice.\n6. Seeking advice - If you think you have grounds to challenge a notice to vacate at VCAT you should seek\nadvice immediately by contacting one of the community legal organisations listed on the Consumer Affairs\nVictoria website. For further information visit the renting section of the Consumer Affairs Victoria website at\nconsumer.vic.gov.au/renting or call 1300 558 181 .\nNOTICE TO VACATE\n7.

Termination Date\nThe termination date must allow for:\n• the minimum notice required under the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 (the Act); and\n• the proposed method of delivery and the date the renter is expected to receive the notice.\nThe minimum number of days’ notice required under the Act is 0.\nI request that you vacate on or before the following termination date: 14 July 2025\nNote: If you want to challenge this notice you should seek legal advice as soon as possible.\n11. Reason for notice\n•The rental provider must select the relevant reason, section number and the minimum notice\nrequired under the act.\n•The rental provider must also explain why the notice has been given. It is not enough to quote\njust from the Act or from the reasons on the information sheet; this must be accompanied by\nspecific details.\n•VCAT may find a notice to vacate invalid where it does not provide enough details or is not\naccompanied by the required documentary evidence.\nI am giving you this notice for the following reason:\nSection 91ZL Unsafe premises\nThe premises are unfit for human habitation or have been destroyed totally, or to such an extent as to be\nrendered unsafe.\nA roof leak from common property caused water to enter the bedroom, resulting in swollen plaster, bubbling\npaint, and visible mould. On 23 May 2025, contractor FIXD Trade Group inspected and confirmed the room is\nunsafe. Urgent mould remediation is required, including sealing the room, chemical treatment, and drying using\nindustrial equipment. Drying is expected to take 7 days, followed by reinstatement of plaster and painting, with\nthe full process taking up to 14 days.\nThe property will be unsafe and unsuitable to occupy during this time due to noise, equipment use, and health\nrisks. Despite multiple written requests, the renter has refused access, preventing critical repairs.\nThis Notice to Vacate is issued to allow urgent works and restore the property to a habitable standard. The\nrenter is required to vacate by 14 July 2025.\nIn many cases this notice must be accompanied by documentary evidence. For information on documentary\nevidence go to www.consumer.vic.gov.au/ntv\nIs documentary evidence attached? Yes\nPlease provide details of the evidence attached:\nMessage Thread Franklin Street (PDF)\nThis includes a detailed email thread between the managing agent, contractor (FIXD Trade Group), and the\nOwners Corporation.
