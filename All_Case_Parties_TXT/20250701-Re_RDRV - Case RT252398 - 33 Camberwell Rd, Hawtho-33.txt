Dear Johnson,

Your three Section-86 notices, lodged by registered post on 27 June 
2025, seek entry at
08:00 AM on 7, 8 and 9 July—only **12 days’** lead time—and leave the 
“Details attached” box
unchecked.  Entry therefore remains conditional.

SEND WITHIN 24 HOURS
   1. Contractor legal name, licence number & 24-hour mobile
   2. Day-by-day work scope (rooms, tasks, time estimates) for the full 
7-day schedule
   3. Risk statement – water / power interruptions & noise levels
   4. Public-liability / PI insurance certificate
   5. “Tax invoice.pdf” **and** the alleged “tenant-confirmation” screenshot
   6. Daily-rate schedule for drying equipment **plus** written 
assurance that no
      “no-access” surcharge will be levied without a Tribunal order

_No bundle → No entry → Call-out fee remains fictional._

**Provisional window (if items 1-6 arrive):** **Wed 9 Jul 2025, 15 : 30 
– 19 : 00 AEST**

**Retaliatory warning** Your 27 Jun 15 : 09 email (“…deduct from your 
bond…”) breaches
s 264 RTA.  Any repeat—or any attempt to impose daily drying fees 
without prior disclosure—
will trigger my application for penalty units and costs.

**Non-confirmation notice** Until items 1-6 are supplied, this email 
does **not** constitute
consent.

Key verbatim excerpts for easy reference:
• *Exh A – 16 Jun 04 : 37 (tenant)* “any update … I’ll reply before 12 : 
00 …”
• *Exh B – 16 Jun 11 : 52 (agent)* “Thanks so much … **for confirming** …”
• *Exh C – 23 Jun 14 : 35 (agent)* “remediation work … 24 Jun 08 : 30 … 
provide access …”
• *Exh D – 27 Jun 15 : 09 (agent)* “**we will deduct it from your bond**.”

Your own notices concede the job “might be extended subject to the 
length of the drying
process” yet provide no timeline or cost caps. Please resolve that 
conflict by supplying
items 1-6 above.

**Attachments**

    Hi Matthew & Chawakorn, ____

    __ __

    Good morning and hope you are well. ____

    I have received the reply from FIXD Trade Group – contractor
    appointed by the OC for the repair. ____

    I have asked for the project timeline, and below is the reply:____

    __ __

    /Please see below extract from our scope of works sent to Highrise
    Strata. ____/

    /__ __/

    /The drying process is essential for ensuring all affected building
    materials return to pre-loss moisture levels. However, the length of
    drying time may vary depending on external factors such as weather
    conditions and moisture content. FIXD is not responsible for delays
    in drying due to uncontrollable factors. Monitoring will be
    conducted *daily*, and any necessary adjustments/cost variations
    will be communicated promptly. FIXD will not be held responsible for
    any pre-existing conditions discovered during the course of
    remediation, including but not limited to structural defects,
    non-compliant installations, or prior water damage. Any discoveries
    will be communicated to the insured, and additional works may be
    required outside the scope of this project.____/

    /We cannot provide a timeline as per your request due to the
    existing site constraints and nature of the damages. ____/

    /Please note, once drying equipment is on-site, it is charged per
    day. If access is not provided as required by our team, extra
    charges may be applicable to the renters for not providing access. ____/

    /__ __/

    Hi Chawakorn, ____


    Since no access was given on 24 June 2025, the contractor has sent
    us the attached invoice.
    Please advise whether you would like to pay them directly. ____

    Otherwise, the OC will settle with FIXD and on-charge the amount to
    Lot 1803A, and the rental provider will be seeking reimbursement
    from you. ____

    Please advise, thank you. ____

    Dear Matthew,

    I just received your email about closing my case and I'm quite
    confused. I thought getting a repair date was just the beginning of
    solving my problems, not the end.

    **The key issues I still need help with are:**
    - Compensation for 70+ days of paying full rent for an unusable bedroom
    - Where to stay during repairs (the agency hasn't provided any
    solution for this yet)
    - This has now affected my studies - my college contacted me this
    week about urgent matters

    **I don't understand - does getting a repair date mean I can't ask
    about these other problems anymore?**

    Thank you so much for arranging the July 7th repair after you
    contacted them. It's amazing they could suddenly arrange it after
    saying they needed 6-7 business days when I was asking, and I'd
    already waited over two months.

    I also wanted to mention that I haven't been able to confirm access
    for the repairs yet because the agency hasn't answered any of my
    previous questions about what exactly will happen during the repairs
    or what solutions they'll provide. From what I understand, my
    flatmate and I will need to leave our rooms during the work, which
    is quite a big decision that affects both our daily lives directly.
    I don't think it makes sense for me to confirm anything when I
    haven't received any information about the details or arrangements.

    I'm very sorry if I'm completely misunderstanding how this process
    works. As an international student who has never dealt with anything
    like this before, I realize I probably don't understand what VCAT
    can and cannot help with. I was hoping you might be able to guide me
    about what's reasonable to expect, but I understand if I'm asking
    for things that aren't part of your role.

    Should I just accept whatever happens with the repairs and forget
    about the past 70+ days and other problems? I don't want to cause
    trouble, but it doesn't feel right to just forget everything that
    happened.

    I'm quite overwhelmed and honestly don't know what to do about the
    compensation and accommodation issues. Could you please help me
    understand if there are options to address these concerns even if
    the repairs get scheduled?

    I hope it's okay to communicate in writing as phone conversations
    are difficult for me with serious matters. I don't have friends or
    family here who understand these problems, so I'm trying to figure
    everything out alone.

    Thank you for your patience with me.

    Thank you,
    Chawakorn Kamnuansil____

        ____

        Hi Matthew, ____


        Thank you for your email.
        I have spoken with them yesterday morning and they have advised
        that due to their tight schedule, they will have to look into
        their booking and let us know when is the next available date. ____

        The contractor advised that the next available date should be
        within the next 6-7 business days. ____


        Since I haven’t received any confirmation, I have just sent
        another email to the OC and the contractor, asking them to
        provide a date & time. ____

        I will let you know once I have heard back from them. ____

        ____

        Thank you. ____

        Good afternoon Johnson____

        ____

        Can you please confirm whether you are able to confirm a time
        that trades will be able to reattend the property. Could you
        please confirm this by close of business today.____

        ____

        If not I will need to progress this matter to a hearing due to
        timeframes required to list urgent repair applications.____

        ____

        If an agreement can be reached regarding a timeframe to resolve
        the repair issue this matter can be struck out with a right of
        reinstatement. I have included the renters in this email for
        reference.____
