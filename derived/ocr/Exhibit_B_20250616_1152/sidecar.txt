Hi Chawakorn,
Thanks so much for checking in and for confirming.

We're currently following up with the Owners Corporation to lock in the repair schedule, and we'll send
through an update as soon as we hear back from their team.

If anything comes through today, I'll definitely pass it on.
Thanks again for your patience and understanding — we're getting closer.

Warm regards,

Sylvia Hao

Dear Chawakorn,

I hope you're well, and thank you again for your continued engagement regarding the repair
matter.

Following instructions from the rental provider, we are now arranging to proceed with the required
repairs to the water-damaged wall and flooring. These works are necessary to prevent further
deterioration of the property.
