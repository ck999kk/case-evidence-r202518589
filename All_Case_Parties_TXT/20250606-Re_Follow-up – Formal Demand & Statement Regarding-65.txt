Dear Sylvia,

Thank you for your response dated Friday, 6 June 2025 at 11:50am.

As the primary resident of the property who has lived through weeks of 
unresolved water damage, I must reiterate that no one is more eager than 
I am to see the situation resolved quickly and properly. However, I am 
currently unable to provide consent for any repair work to begin.

Firstly, your email referred to repairs commencing on "Thursday, 6 
June"a date which had already passed at the time of your message. This 
inconsistency is not just confusing; it is logistically impossible and 
calls into question the seriousness of the repair planning. Such unclear 
and last-minute communication cannot form the basis for valid consent.

Secondly, I must emphasise that I cannot authorise access until the 
following points are clearly confirmed in writing:

1. A definitive and specific repair timeline, including projected 
completion date.
2. Whether temporary relocation will be required, and if so, what 
arrangements or compensation are being offered.
3. Your position on my formal request for rent reduction and 
confirmation of non-liability, which remain outstanding.
4. Acknowledgment of the impact on my co-tenant, who is also named in 
the lease agreement, and who will equally be affected by noise and 
accessibility issues related to the drying equipment.

It is my responsibility to ensure that any agreement made does not 
inadvertently waive our legal rights or create further hardship. I must 
act cautiously, especially as the installation of industrial drying 
equipment operating 24/7 poses real disturbancessomething your office 
acknowledged in our previous phone call.

If I were to consent now without these matters resolved in writing, it 
could later be used to suggest that I accepted all resulting conditions, 
which I absolutely do not.

Therefore, I will only provide access once I receive formal written 
confirmation addressing all points above. Until then, I consider it 
unreasonable to demand a commitment from me, especially under these 
unclear and one-sided circumstances.

As noted in my formal demand, if a resolution is not reached within five 
(5) calendar daysincluding weekendsI will proceed to file an application 
with VCAT.

Kind regards,

Chawakorn Kamnuansil

    Dear Chawakorn,

    Thank you for your email and the supporting documents outlining your
    concerns and formal request.

    We understand the impact this situation has had on your tenancy and
    appreciate the way you’ve approached the matter. We will now forward
    your request and documentation to the Owners Corporation for
    consideration of a rent compensation claim based on the current
    circumstances.

    In the meantime, we are aiming to proceed with the repair works as
    soon as possible. Could you kindly confirm whether works can
    commence on Thursday, 6 June 2025, or let us know your earliest
    availability to provide access?

    We will continue to keep you updated as we receive further
    information from the Owners Corporation.

    Kind regards,

    *Sylvia Hao*

        Dear Sylvia,


        I am writing with the intent of resolving this matter
        constructively and without escalation, if possible.


        Over the past two months, I have reported the water damage issue
        multiple times in good faith, cooperated with your office, and
        done my best to remain in the property despite the difficulties.
        I am not trying to be confrontational; I simply need a clear and
        reasonable outcome, supported by appropriate action and
        communication.


        Please find attached:


         1.

            A formal demand letter outlining my request for rent
            compensation, a firm repair timeline, and confirmation of
            non-liability – based on my rights under the Residential
            Tenancies Act 1997 (VIC).

         2.

            A supporting tenant statement summarising the verbal
            communication with your office around 2–3 June 2025,
            including the temporary accommodation proposal and its
            impractical conditions.



        If a fair and written resolution is not reached within five (5)
        business days, I will have no choice but to initiate proceedings
        through VCAT. I sincerely hope this can be avoided and that we
        can achieve a reasonable solution for all parties involved.


        I would appreciate your written response at your earliest
        convenience.


        Kind regards,

        Chawakorn Kamnuansil
