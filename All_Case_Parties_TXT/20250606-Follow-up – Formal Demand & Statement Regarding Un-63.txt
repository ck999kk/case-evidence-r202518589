Dear Sylvia,


I am writing with the intent of resolving this matter constructively and 
without escalation, if possible.


Over the past two months, I have reported the water damage issue 
multiple times in good faith, cooperated with your office, and done my 
best to remain in the property despite the difficulties. I am not trying 
to be confrontational; I simply need a clear and reasonable outcome, 
supported by appropriate action and communication.


Please find attached:

 1.

    A formal demand letter outlining my request for rent compensation, a
    firm repair timeline, and confirmation of non-liability – based on
    my rights under the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 (VIC).

 2.

    A supporting tenant statement summarising the verbal communication
    with your office around 2–3 June 2025, including the temporary
    accommodation proposal and its impractical conditions.


If a fair and written resolution is not reached within five (5) business 
days, I will have no choice but to initiate proceedings through VCAT. I 
sincerely hope this can be avoided and that we can achieve a reasonable 
solution for all parties involved.


I would appreciate your written response at your earliest convenience.


Kind regards,

Chawakorn Kamnuansil
