Without Prejudice · Subject to Contract · Save as to Costs

Please confirm acceptance by: 23 August 2025, 17:00 AEST

On acceptance, I will request a VCAT consent order.

Dear Jamie Ong,

VCAT has dismissed the possession application in R202518589/00. I 
propose the following to conclude this matter efficiently.

*Proposed Terms*

  *

    Compensation: AUD 10,000 lump sum, payable by bank transfer (details
    on acceptance).

  *

    Rent freeze: Rent fixed at $2,825/month for 24 months from the
    acceptance date.

  *

    File management and internal actions:

      o

        Within 7 days of acceptance, confirm in writing that:

      o

        Sylvia Hao and Johnson Tan will no longer be involved.

      o

        Appropriate internal actions have been taken.

      o

        Documentary confirmation will be provided.

  *

    Bond: Maintain/return in full with no deductions.

  *

    Authority & escalation: See *Leverage & Enforcement* for authority
    and escalation requirements.

*Leverage & Enforcement*

  *

    Time of the essence: Offer expires 23 August 2025, 17:00 AEST.

  *

    Without prejudice — save as to costs: This correspondence may be
    relied upon as to costs.

  *

    Authority warranty: The signatory warrants authority to bind the
    agency and rental provider. If authority is limited, escalate to the
    OIEC/Principal and confirm within 7 days.

  *

    No re-filing: Following acceptance, no further possession action
    will be taken on the same facts or grounds as R202518589/00.

  *

    Non-retaliation & file controls: No adverse action against the
    renters. Sylvia Hao and Johnson Tan are removed from any
    involvement. Confirm file annotations and handover.

  *

    Default consequences: If the deadline passes without acceptance, I
    will proceed with: (i) a VCAT compensation application with costs
    and statutory penalty interest under the Penalty Interest Rates Act
    1983 (Vic) at the applicable rate, (ii) a complaint to Consumer
    Affairs Victoria (EARS) and the Business Licensing Authority, and
    (iii) where applicable, a complaint to the Victorian Ombudsman.

  *

    Confidentiality: Settlement terms to be recorded in a VCAT consent
    order or deed; confidentiality to the extent permitted by law.

If accepted, these terms will constitute a full and final settlement of 
the issues raised to date. I will ask VCAT to issue a consent order or 
strike out the case with a right to apply for reinstatement to ensure 
enforceability.

*Financial Breakdown*

Rent reduction baseline: 30% × $2,825 × ~4 months (16 Apr–14 Aug = 120 
days) = $3,390.00

VCAT fee paid: $74.10

Post-order rolling abatement (from 15 Aug): $27.85/day* until repair 
completion & handover

*Calculation: (2,825 × 12 × 30%) / 365 ≈ $27.85/day.

*Payment* On acceptance, request my EFT details by emailing 
ck.chawakorn@gmail.com. Cheque or PayID is also acceptable.

*Acceptance Instructions*

  *

    Email subject: ACCEPTED — Franklin 1803 Settlement

  *

    Body: “Accepted as proposed. Please provide EFT details.”

  *

    Target transfer date: within 3 business days of acceptance.

This proposal is made on a commercial basis, without admission of 
liability by either party, and is without prejudice and subject to contract.
