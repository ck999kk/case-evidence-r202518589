Hi Chawakorn,

Thank you for your email, and I do apologise for the lack of updates — I 
understand your concerns and appreciate your continued patience.

The plumber who attended the unit last Wednesday was arranged by the 
Owner’s Corporation to address the leak from the hot water system. We 
are currently waiting on their formal report to confirm that the issue 
has been fully resolved.

In the meantime, could you please let me know if there has been any 
further water ingress or signs of dampness since their visit? This will 
help ensure there are no ongoing issues.

Once we receive confirmation that the source of the leak is no longer 
active, we will arrange for quotations to repair the internal damage, 
including the wall and potentially affected carpet and underlay.

I understand how frustrating this situation is and will continue to 
follow up with the relevant parties to ensure the matter is addressed 
appropriately.

Kind Regards,

	*Sylvia Hao

Hi Sylvia,

It’s been over a week since the plumber attended, and I’ve yet to see 
any update or progress on the condition of my unit. I had already sent 
photos clearly showing wall damage — fixing the leak alone doesn’t 
resolve everything.

This unit is carpeted, and the leak went on for days. It’s only logical 
to assume the carpet and underlay have been affected too. Does it really 
make sense to think the issue ends with the hot water pipe?

Also, why has there been complete silence? It’s not even during a public 
holiday period this time, and yet I’m still left waiting with no 
information. Is the delay coming from the building manager, or is the 
owner just not interested in maintaining their own property?

I’ve been patient long enough. Please advise what steps are being taken 
regarding both the wall and the carpet, and whether an inspection will 
be arranged.

Regards,

Chawakorn
