Good afternoon Johnson

Can you please confirm whether you are able to confirm a time that 
trades will be able to reattend the property. Could you please confirm 
this by close of business today.

If not I will need to progress this matter to a hearing due to 
timeframes required to list urgent repair applications.

If an agreement can be reached regarding a timeframe to resolve the 
repair issue this matter can be struck out with a right of 
reinstatement. I have included the renters in this email for reference.

Regards,

*Matthew T.**
