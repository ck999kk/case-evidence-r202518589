    *Subject:* Urgent: Water Damage on Bedroom Wall (Unit 1803)____

    __ __

    Dear Hilary,____

    __ __

    I’m contacting you regarding an urgent issue in my unit (1803, 243
    Franklin Street). This evening , I noticed a water leak forming on
    the wall above my bed. Within a single day, it spread rapidly — now
    forming a long vertical swelling nearly from ceiling to floor.____

    __ __

    I live on the top floor, so this may indicate a ceiling or roof
    issue. I’m concerned it could worsen quickly if not addressed.____

    __ __

    Please arrange for a maintenance inspection as soon as possible.
    I’ve attached photos for reference. Let me know if I need to do
    anything in the meantime.____

    __ __

    Also, I’d appreciate an update on the status of the bed repair I
    previously reported.____

    __ __

    Thanks,____

    Chawakorn____
