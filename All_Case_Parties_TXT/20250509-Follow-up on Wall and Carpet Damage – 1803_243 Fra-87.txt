Hi Sylvia,


It’s been over a week since the plumber attended, and I’ve yet to see 
any update or progress on the condition of my unit. I had already sent 
photos clearly showing wall damage — fixing the leak alone doesn’t 
resolve everything.


This unit is carpeted, and the leak went on for days. It’s only logical 
to assume the carpet and underlay have been affected too. Does it really 
make sense to think the issue ends with the hot water pipe?


Also, why has there been complete silence? It’s not even during a public 
holiday period this time, and yet I’m still left waiting with no 
information. Is the delay coming from the building manager, or is the 
owner just not interested in maintaining their own property?


I’ve been patient long enough. Please advise what steps are being taken 
regarding both the wall and the carpet, and whether an inspection will 
be arranged.


Regards,

Chawakorn
