Dear Chawakorn,

You have recently been issued a notice to vacate by the property owner, 
with a required move-out date of 14/07/2025.

To facilitate a smooth and efficient vacating process, we kindly ask you 
to carefully review and follow the instructions provided below.
*Final Payments:*
Your rental status is currently paid to the 22/07/2025 with $0.00 on 
account.
A payment of $0.00 is due and payable prior to you vacating the property 
for the period up to the 14/07/2025.
*Where to return keys:* Please return keys & a copy of any cleaning 
receipts to our office at 33 Camberwell Road, Hawthorn East Vic 3123 
between office hours. We are open Monday to Friday between 8.30am – 
5.30pm during office hours. Please note, that if keys are not returned 
on or before the vacate date, rent will continue to be charged at the 
daily rate.
*Power Connection:* We recommend keeping the power connected for three 
business days after you return your keys. This will allow the final 
inspection to be completed with the power on. If the power is 
disconnected, we will need to establish a new connection, which may 
delay the bond return.
*Final Inspection:* We will conduct a final inspection of the property 
within 3 business days of the keys being returned. You are invited to 
attend the final inspection. If you would like to attend, please let me 
know ASAP so I can arrange a suitable time with you.
*Bond Return:* To ensure a speedy return of your bond, please return the 
property in its original condition, less normal wear and tear. You can 
expect your bond to be returned within 10 business days. For clarity on 
property expectations and to expedite the bond return process, please 
refer to the attached “Move out guide & tips to get your bond back.”
*Utility Cancelation:* Ensure that you contact all your utility 
providers to advise your intended vacate date. Any bills or charges 
incurred after your vacate date will be your responsibility.
*Cleaning:* We kindly ask that you leave the property in a clean and 
tidy state, as outlined in the rental agreement & as per the in-going 
condition report. To assist with the cleaning process, we have attached 
the document labelled “Vacate cleaning guide’’ to help you or your 
preferred cleaner.
*Keys and Property Access*: Please ensure that all keys, remotes, and 
other access devices provided to you are returned to the office and 
signed back in by your vacate date. Any unreturned or lost items will 
need to be replaced at your expense. Do not leave keys in the letterbox 
due to the risk of theft. Renters are responsible for replacing locks 
and keys if they are stolen from the letterbox.

If you have any questions or need clarification on any of the above 
points, please don't hesitate to reach out.
Warm regards,
Sylvia Hao
