Hi Chawakorn

Here is your monthly after-hours trades list update. This update ensures 
that you always have the most up-to-date version.

Please save this in a place where you can quickly refer to it in case of 
an emergency.

Your safety and the condition of your home are our top priorities. Below 
are the procedures for reporting urgent repairs and emergency maintenance:
*_What is an urgent repair?_*
An urgent repair is any issue that poses an immediate danger to you or 
the property. Legally, urgent repairs include:

  * Burst water service
  * Blocked or broken toilet system
  * Serious roof leak
  * Gas leak
  * Dangerous electrical fault
  * Flooding or serious flood damage
  * Serious storm or fire damage
  * An essential service or appliance for hot water, water, cooking,
    heating, or laundering is not working
  * The gas, electricity or water supply is not working
  * A cooling appliance or service provided by the rental provider is
    not working
  * The property does not meet minimum standards
  * A safety-related device, such as a smoke alarm or pool fence, is not
    working
  * An appliance, fitting or fixture that is not working and causes a
    lot of water to be wasted
  * Any fault or damage in the property that makes it unsafe or
    insecure, including pests, mould or damp caused by or related to the
    building structure
  * A serious problem with a lift or staircase.

Maintenance items not on the above list are considered non-urgent and 
must be reported in writing.
*How to Report Urgent Maintenance*
*During Business Hours:*
Please contact our office directly at 03 8686 8388 and email your 
property manager at mpm@email.propertyme.com 
<mailto:mpm@email.propertyme.com> with photos and details of the 
required maintenance.

*After Hours Tradesperson List:*
*NOTE:* Before contacting an urgent tradesperson, ensure that the 
maintenance issue is genuinely urgent. Additionally, email your property 
manager with the following details:

  * Description of the maintenance issue
  * Reason for urgency
  * If the tradesperson you contacted could not resolve the problem over
    the phone
  * Events leading up to the urgent call
  * Photos and/or video documentation of the issue
  * The name of the company you arranged, and if you arranged a trade
    not on our list, please provide their contact details


*How to Report Non-Urgent Maintenance*
All non-urgent maintenance requests should be submitted emailed to 
mpm@email.propertyme.com <mailto:mpm@email.propertyme.com>. Non-urgent 
maintenance will be addressed when the office reopens. We appreciate 
your understanding and cooperation in this matter.

In the event that trade on the above list is unable to attend, an 
alternative local tradesperson may be engaged. Please be careful who you 
engage by checking Google reviews to avoid overpriced and dishonest 
tradespeople.
Please note, if you do arrange your own trades that they may bill you 
directly. Please seek reimbursement from your property manager accordingly.
We appreciate your cooperation in promptly reporting any issues so we 
can address them effectively.
Please Note: If a tradesperson visits and finds no faults, determines 
that the issue resulted from user error, or the maintenance is of a 
non-urgent nature, the renter may be responsible for the associated costs.

*If you have any feedback regarding my service, please feel free to 
contact my manager.*
