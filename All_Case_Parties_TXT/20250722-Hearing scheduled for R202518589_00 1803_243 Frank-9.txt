    *Attending a Hearing*

Your Notice of Hearing will tell you whether you need to join by phone 
or videoconference.
*If your hearing is by phone conference*, you must phone VCAT. The phone 
number and pin number are on your Notice of Hearing. VCAT cannot call 
you. If you do not phone into your hearing, the hearing will go ahead 
without you having an opportunity to tell your side to the member.

    *Why you should attend*

It's important you attend the hearing to present your evidence and have 
your say. You may be able to come to an agreement with the other party. 
For example, if you are facing eviction, you may be able to work out a 
payment plan with the landlord and stay in your rental property.
If you don't attend, a decision can be made in your absence.

*Send your documents*

You must email all evidence that you want to use in your hearing to the 
other party and VCAT *at least 7 days* before your hearing.
