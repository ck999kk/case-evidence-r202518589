*Hi *Chawakorn & Podjana,

Good afternoon and hope you are well.

FIXD has scheduled the repair work and we have sent out the notice of 
entry accordingly – please refer to the attached.

Repair works are required in the bedroom due to water ingress from the 
common property. Highrise Strata has appointed FIXD Trade Group to carry 
out these works.

*Phase 1 repairs – Drying process – are scheduled for:*
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9 September 2025 (excluding Sunday, 7 September 2025).

This timeframe can vary, taking either less or more days depending on 
drying times. Once it has been confirmed that the drying has been 
completed, Phase 2 (rectification) will then begin. At that stage, FIXD 
will be able to provide an estimate of works once they have fully 
assessed the damage.

Access will be needed from 8:00am on these dates, though the exact times 
may vary from day to day depending on how the works are progressing, 
drying times, and other factors that can’t be predicted in advance. FIXD 
will keep you updated as the works move along and will communicate with 
you about timings so you’re aware.

We thank you in advance for your cooperation and will have these works 
completed as quickly as possible.

Kind Regards,

	*Shaun Young
