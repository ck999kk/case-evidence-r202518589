Dear Chawakorn,

Thank you for your recent email. I understand this has been a 
frustrating and challenging situation, and I appreciate you taking the 
time to outline your position.

The damage to the bedroom has resulted from a leak originating from 
common property. Responsibility for repairing both the source of the 
leak and the resultant damage lies with the party responsible — in this 
case, the Owners Corporation. They have taken steps to arrange the 
necessary works and have offered $800 in compensation to reflect the 
inconvenience caused to date.

Despite multiple written requests and the issuing of a formal Notice of 
Entry, access to the property has not yet been provided. We understand 
you may have concerns, but the works are essential, and the Owners 
Corporation has been actively trying to resolve the issue. We are 
currently waiting on a revised date from their trades. Once confirmed, a 
new Notice of Entry will be issued. On that date, both the agent and 
trades will attend to carry out the works. If access is again refused, 
we will proceed with an application to VCAT for a compliance order.

Our preference is to cooperate with you to ensure the repairs can 
proceed on the earliest available date. The sooner access is granted, 
the sooner this matter can be resolved.

We remain open to working with you constructively. During the VCAT 
hearing, the Tribunal member noted that staying in the second bedroom or 
the lounge room during the repair period would be a reasonable 
short-term arrangement. While we understand the second bedroom is 
currently occupied by the other tenant and this may not be ideal, it 
remains a temporary option to consider. If that arrangement isn’t 
workable, the option to end the lease early without penalty remains 
available.

In regard to your proposal, we do not agree to the requested $10,000 
lump sum or a 24-month rent freeze. These terms are not proportionate, 
particularly given that access for repairs has not yet been provided. 
Any future compensation claim would also be assessed in light of whether 
reasonable steps were taken to mitigate loss. In this case, the matter 
could have been resolved some time ago had access been granted.

We’ll be in touch again once the repair date is confirmed. In the 
meantime, we ask that you confirm your willingness to allow access on 
the upcoming date, so the matter can be finalised without further 
escalation.

Kind Regards,

	*Jamie Ong

*Subject:* Without Prejudice — Franklin 1803: Settlement Terms (VCAT 
R2025/18589/00)

Without Prejudice · Subject to Contract · Save as to Costs

Please confirm acceptance by: 23 August 2025, 17:00 AEST

On acceptance, I will request a VCAT consent order.

Dear Jamie Ong,

VCAT has dismissed the possession application in R202518589/00. I 
propose the following to conclude this matter efficiently.

*Proposed Terms*

  * Compensation: AUD 10,000 lump sum, payable by bank transfer (details
    on acceptance).
  * Rent freeze: Rent fixed at $2,825/month for 24 months from the
    acceptance date.
  * File management and internal actions:

      o Within 7 days of acceptance, confirm in writing that:
      o Sylvia Hao and Johnson Tan will no longer be involved.
      o Appropriate internal actions have been taken.
      o Documentary confirmation will be provided.

  * Bond: Maintain/return in full with no deductions.
  * Authority & escalation: See *Leverage & Enforcement* for authority
    and escalation requirements.

*Leverage & Enforcement*

  * Time of the essence: Offer expires 23 August 2025, 17:00 AEST.
  * Without prejudice — save as to costs: This correspondence may be
    relied upon as to costs.
  * Authority warranty: The signatory warrants authority to bind the
    agency and rental provider. If authority is limited, escalate to the
    OIEC/Principal and confirm within 7 days.
  * No re-filing: Following acceptance, no further possession action
    will be taken on the same facts or grounds as R202518589/00.
  * Non-retaliation & file controls: No adverse action against the
    renters. Sylvia Hao and Johnson Tan are removed from any
    involvement. Confirm file annotations and handover.
  * Default consequences: If the deadline passes without acceptance, I
    will proceed with: (i) a VCAT compensation application with costs
    and statutory penalty interest under the Penalty Interest Rates Act
    1983 (Vic) at the applicable rate, (ii) a complaint to Consumer
    Affairs Victoria (EARS) and the Business Licensing Authority, and
    (iii) where applicable, a complaint to the Victorian Ombudsman.
  * Confidentiality: Settlement terms to be recorded in a VCAT consent
    order or deed; confidentiality to the extent permitted by law.

If accepted, these terms will constitute a full and final settlement of 
the issues raised to date. I will ask VCAT to issue a consent order or 
strike out the case with a right to apply for reinstatement to ensure 
enforceability.

*Financial Breakdown*

Rent reduction baseline: 30% × $2,825 × ~4 months (16 Apr–14 Aug = 120 
days) = $3,390.00

VCAT fee paid: $74.10

Post-order rolling abatement (from 15 Aug): $27.85/day* until repair 
completion & handover

*Calculation: (2,825 × 12 × 30%) / 365 ≈ $27.85/day.

*Payment* On acceptance, request my EFT details by emailing 
ck.chawakorn@gmail.com <mailto:ck.chawakorn@gmail.com>. Cheque or PayID 
is also acceptable.

*Acceptance Instructions*

  * Email subject: ACCEPTED — Franklin 1803 Settlement
  * Body: “Accepted as proposed. Please provide EFT details.”
  * Target transfer date: within 3 business days of acceptance.

This proposal is made on a commercial basis, without admission of 
liability by either party, and is without prejudice and subject to contract.

Reference: Attachment C — Johnson email, 9 Jul 2025.

I am keen to continue the tenancy on a positive footing.
