Hi Sylvia,


It=E2=80=99s been over a week since the plumber attended, and I=E2=80=99ve =
yet to see any
update or progress on the condition of my unit. I had already sent photos
clearly showing wall damage =E2=80=94 fixing the leak alone doesn=E2=80=99t=
 resolve
everything.


This unit is carpeted, and the leak went on for days. It=E2=80=99s only log=
ical to
assume the carpet and underlay have been affected too. Does it really make
sense to think the issue ends with the hot water pipe?


Also, why has there been complete silence? It=E2=80=99s not even during a p=
ublic
holiday period this time, and yet I=E2=80=99m still left waiting with no
information. Is the delay coming from the building manager, or is the owner
just not interested in maintaining their own property?


I=E2=80=99ve been patient long enough. Please advise what steps are being t=
aken
regarding both the wall and the carpet, and whether an inspection will be
arranged.


Regards,

Chawakorn
