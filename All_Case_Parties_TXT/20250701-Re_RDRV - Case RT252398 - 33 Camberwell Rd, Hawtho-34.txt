Hi Matthew,

We would like to bring to your attention that over the past few weeks, 
we have made every reasonable effort to coordinate with the Owners 
Corporation (OC) and the appointed contractor, FIXD, to facilitate 
essential repair works at the property. This is now our second attempt 
to proceed with the repairs. To clarify, all relevant parties – 
including the OC, FIXD, our agency as the managing agent, and the rental 
provider are fully committed to commencing and completing the necessary 
repairs as promptly as possible.

We are more than willing to provide any further information the renter 
may reasonably request to facilitate cooperation. However, we 
respectfully request that VCAT take into account that _we are 
*NOT*_**the party impeding progress.

Hi Chawakorn,

Please refer to below response in blue, as I have communicated with FIXD 
prior to this email.

I will get the remaining requested details from FIXD, but I can’t 
guarantee that they will reply within 24 hours.

Given that coordinating this repair requires the involvement of multiple 
parties and significant resources, your cooperation is not only 
appreciated but essential to ensure the work can proceed without further 
delay.

Thank you.



Kind Regards,

Dear Johnson,

Your three Section-86 notices, lodged by registered post on 27 June 
2025, seek entry at
08:00 AM on 7, 8 and 9 July—only **12 days’** lead time—and leave the 
“Details attached” box
unchecked.  Entry therefore remains conditional.

SEND WITHIN 24 HOURS
   1. Contractor legal name, licence number & 24-hour mobile – Pending 
FIXD’s reply
   2. Day-by-day work scope (rooms, tasks, time estimates) for the full 
7-day schedule The first stage of the repair involves reducing the 
moisture levels in the affected bedroom, as outlined in the Notice of 
Entry. During this drying process, the contractor will require daily 
access to the room in order to monitor and record moisture readings. At 
this stage, they are unable to provide specific time estimates for this 
phase, as the duration will depend on how quickly acceptable moisture 
levels are reached. Once the area has dried sufficiently, they will 
proceed with the necessary repair work. Please note that because the 
contractor has not yet assessed the current site conditions in full, 
they are unable to provide a definitive timeline or scope for the 
repairs at this time.

   3. Risk statement – water / power interruptions & noise levels - 
Pending FIXD’s reply
   4. Public-liability / PI insurance certificate - Pending FIXD’s reply
   5. “Tax invoice.pdf” **and** the alleged “tenant-confirmation” 
screenshot FIXD has been engaged by the Owners Corporation, as the 
source of the leak originates from a common area. The OC will cover the 
cost of the repairs once the work is completed. At this stage, FIXD is 
unable to provide a quote, as they have not yet been able to assess the 
current site conditions in detail. Could you please clarify what you 
mean by a “tenant-confirmation screenshot”?
   6. Daily-rate schedule for drying equipment **plus** written 
assurance that no
      “no-access” surcharge will be levied without a Tribunal order As 
previously mentioned, FIXD is the contractor appointed by the Owners 
Corporation (OC), and the OC will be covering the cost of the scheduled 
works. Could you please clarify the relevance of the “daily-rate 
schedule for drying equipment”? There will be no additional charges 
incurred, provided FIXD is granted access in accordance with the Notice 
of Entry and there are no delays caused by restricted access or 
obstruction to the repair process.



_No bundle → No entry → Call-out fee remains fictional._

**Provisional window (if items 1-6 arrive):** **Wed 9 Jul 2025, 15 : 30 
– 19 : 00 AEST**

**Retaliatory warning** Your 27 Jun 15 : 09 email (“…deduct from your 
bond…”) breaches
s 264 RTA.  Any repeat—or any attempt to impose daily drying fees 
without prior disclosure—
will trigger my application for penalty units and costs.

**Non-confirmation notice** Until items 1-6 are supplied, this email 
does **not** constitute
consent.

Key verbatim excerpts for easy reference:
• *Exh A – 16 Jun 04 : 37 (tenant)* “any update … I’ll reply before 12 :

provide access …”
• *Exh D – 27 Jun 15 : 09 (agent)* “**we will deduct it from your bond**.”

Your own notices concede the job “might be extended subject to the 
length of the drying
process” yet provide no timeline or cost caps. Please resolve that 
conflict by supplying
items 1-6 above.

    Hi Chawakorn & Matthew,

    Good afternoon and hope you all are well.

    Quick update, we have served 3 x notice of entry today via
    registered post (please refer to the files attached).

    FIXD will need access to the property at 8AM on 7 July 2025, and for
    the rest of the week as mentioned in the notice.

    This will be the first stage of remediation work, which is to treat
    the mould and bring the moisture level down.

    They might not need to be in the property for the entire 9 hours in
    the first few days, but they will need access to check the moisture
    level in daily basis.

    Please be advised that if FIXD is unable to commence the work due to
    deny of access, the minimum labour charge applies and the cost will
    be forwarded to you.

    Please let us know if you have any questions about this. Thank you.

    Kind Regards,

    Hi Matthew & Chawakorn,

    Good morning and hope you are well.

    I have received the reply from FIXD Trade Group – contractor
    appointed by the OC for the repair.

    I have asked for the project timeline, and below is the reply:

    /Please see below extract from our scope of works sent to Highrise
    Strata. /

    //

    /The drying process is essential for ensuring all affected building
    materials return to pre-loss moisture levels. However, the length of
    drying time may vary depending on external factors such as weather
    conditions and moisture content. FIXD is not responsible for delays
    in drying due to uncontrollable factors. Monitoring will be
    conducted *daily*, and any necessary adjustments/cost variations
    will be communicated promptly. FIXD will not be held responsible for
    any pre-existing conditions discovered during the course of
    remediation, including but not limited to structural defects,
    non-compliant installations, or prior water damage. Any discoveries
    will be communicated to the insured, and additional works may be
    required outside the scope of this project./

    /We cannot provide a timeline as per your request due to the
    existing site constraints and nature of the damages. /

    /Please note, once drying equipment is on-site, it is charged per
    day. If access is not provided as required by our team, extra
    charges may be applicable to the renters for not providing access. /

    //

    Hi Chawakorn,


    Since no access was given on 24 June 2025, the contractor has sent
    us the attached invoice.
    Please advise whether you would like to pay them directly.

    Otherwise, the OC will settle with FIXD and on-charge the amount to
    Lot 1803A, and the rental provider will be seeking reimbursement
    from you.

    Please advise, thank you.

    Hi Matthew,

    Thank you for your call earlier.

    I have confirmed with the contractor from FIXD Trade Group, the work
    is now scheduled for 7 July 2025.

    This is the exact same job scope, which was scheduled for 24 June
    2025, but no access was granted that day.

    The work consists of few stages, and the trade will not be able to
    send me the timeline until he is back to the office tomorrow.

    On 7 July 2025, the work will be mould remediation, which is to
    bring the moisture level in the affected bedroom down.

    Once the moisture level is at the appropriate level, the damage
    rectification job will be commenced (wall repair & etc).

    FIXD Trade Group will need multiple entries for the entire repair work.

    Once I have received the timeline from them, I will forward it
    across so that we are all on the same page.

    If you need any further details, please feel free to reach out, thanks!

    Dear Matthew,

    I just received your email about closing my case and I'm quite
    confused. I thought getting a repair date was just the beginning of
    solving my problems, not the end.

    **The key issues I still need help with are:**
    - Compensation for 70+ days of paying full rent for an unusable bedroom
    - Where to stay during repairs (the agency hasn't provided any
    solution for this yet)
    - This has now affected my studies - my college contacted me this
    week about urgent matters

    **I don't understand - does getting a repair date mean I can't ask
    about these other problems anymore?**

    Thank you so much for arranging the July 7th repair after you
    contacted them. It's amazing they could suddenly arrange it after
    saying they needed 6-7 business days when I was asking, and I'd
    already waited over two months.

    I also wanted to mention that I haven't been able to confirm access
    for the repairs yet because the agency hasn't answered any of my
    previous questions about what exactly will happen during the repairs
    or what solutions they'll provide. From what I understand, my
    flatmate and I will need to leave our rooms during the work, which
    is quite a big decision that affects both our daily lives directly.
    I don't think it makes sense for me to confirm anything when I
    haven't received any information about the details or arrangements.

    I'm very sorry if I'm completely misunderstanding how this process
    works. As an international student who has never dealt with anything
    like this before, I realize I probably don't understand what VCAT
    can and cannot help with. I was hoping you might be able to guide me
    about what's reasonable to expect, but I understand if I'm asking
    for things that aren't part of your role.

    Should I just accept whatever happens with the repairs and forget
    about the past 70+ days and other problems? I don't want to cause
    trouble, but it doesn't feel right to just forget everything that
    happened.

    I'm quite overwhelmed and honestly don't know what to do about the
    compensation and accommodation issues. Could you please help me
    understand if there are options to address these concerns even if
    the repairs get scheduled?

    I hope it's okay to communicate in writing as phone conversations
    are difficult for me with serious matters. I don't have friends or
    family here who understand these problems, so I'm trying to figure
    everything out alone.

    Thank you for your patience with me.

    Thank you,
    Chawakorn Kamnuansil

        Hi Matthew,


        Thank you for your email.
        I have spoken with them yesterday morning and they have advised
        that due to their tight schedule, they will have to look into
        their booking and let us know when is the next available date.

        The contractor advised that the next available date should be
        within the next 6-7 business days.


        Since I haven’t received any confirmation, I have just sent
        another email to the OC and the contractor, asking them to
        provide a date & time.

        I will let you know once I have heard back from them.

        Thank you.

        Good afternoon Johnson

        Can you please confirm whether you are able to confirm a time
        that trades will be able to reattend the property. Could you
        please confirm this by close of business today.

        If not I will need to progress this matter to a hearing due to
        timeframes required to list urgent repair applications.

        If an agreement can be reached regarding a timeframe to resolve
        the repair issue this matter can be struck out with a right of
        reinstatement. I have included the renters in this email for
        reference.

        Regards,

        *Matthew T.**
