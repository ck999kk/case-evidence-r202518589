In the event that trade on the above list is unable to attend, an alternative local tradesperson may be
engaged. Please be careful who you engage by checking Google reviews to avoid overpriced and
dishonest tradespeople.

Please note, if you do arrange your own trades that they may bill you directly. Please seek
reimbursement from your property manager accordingly.

We appreciate your cooperation in promptly reporting any issues so we can address them effectively.

Please Note: If a tradesperson visits and finds no faults, determines that the issue resulted from user
error, or the maintenance is of a non-urgent nature, the renter may be responsible for the associated

costs.
