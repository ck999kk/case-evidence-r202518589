appeared and spread rapidly from ceiling to floor within 24 hours. Source identified as hot
water system leak in ceiling on 28 April 2025. Bedroom has been unusable for over 2
months due to persistent moisture, mold growth, structural damage, and safety concerns.
Complete remediation including wall restoration and carpet replacement has not been

Property Propdoes not meet?minimum standards:

Bedroom fails to meet minimum standards under Residential Tenancies Act due to: (1)
Unusable sleeping area for 2+ months, (2) Persistent moisture and mold creating health
hazards, (3) Structural damage compromising safety, (4) Inadequate ventilation causing
ongoing damp conditions. Property manager has failed to restore habitability within
reasonable timeframe despite multiple requests.

Water services (burst):

Hot water system leak in ceiling identified on 28 April 2025 by plumber. Initial leak caused
extensive water damage to bedroom wall and flooring. While source leak reportedly fixed,
internal damage including wall restoration, mold remediation, and carpet replacement
remains incomplete. Water damage continues to impact habitability of bedroom.

Unsafe or insecure fault or damage in the property: including?pests, mould or
damp?caused by or related to the building structure:

Ongoing mold growth and damp conditions in bedroom creating health hazards. Structural
wall damage from water ingress compromises safety. Persistent musty odors and poor air
quality documented in medical certificate from Era Health dated 23 June 2025. Bedroom
remains uninhabitable due to safety and health concerns from unresolved water damage.

Steps taken to resolve the issue:

Water damage was first reported on 16 April 2025. Property management was transferred
from Hilary Ho to Sylvia Hao on the same day without addressing the urgent issue. Multiple
follow-up emails were sent on 20 April, 23 April, and throughout May 2025. A plumber
identified the source as a hot water system leak on 28 April 2025, but complete repairs
including wall restoration, mold remediation, and carpet replacement have not been
completed. The bedroom remains unusable for over 2 months. Repairs are now scheduled
for 24 June 2025 at 8:30 AM with no alternative accommodation provided.

Have you raised the issue(s) in writing with your rental provider or real estate agent:
