Hi Chawakorn,

Thanks so much for checking in and for confirming.

We're currently following up with the Owners Corporation to lock in the repair schedule, and we'll send
through an update as soon as we hear back from their team.

If anything comes through today, I'll definitely pass it on.
Thanks again for your patience and understanding — we’re getting closer.

Warm regards,

Sylvia Hao
