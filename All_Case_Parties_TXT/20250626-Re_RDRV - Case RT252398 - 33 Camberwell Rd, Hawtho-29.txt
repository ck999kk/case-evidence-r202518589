Dear Matthew,

I just received your email about closing my case and I'm quite confused. 
I thought getting a repair date was just the beginning of solving my 
problems, not the end.

**The key issues I still need help with are:**
- Compensation for 70+ days of paying full rent for an unusable bedroom
- Where to stay during repairs (the agency hasn't provided any solution 
for this yet)
- This has now affected my studies - my college contacted me this week 
about urgent matters

**I don't understand - does getting a repair date mean I can't ask about 
these other problems anymore?**

Thank you so much for arranging the July 7th repair after you contacted 
them. It's amazing they could suddenly arrange it after saying they 
needed 6-7 business days when I was asking, and I'd already waited over 
two months.

I also wanted to mention that I haven't been able to confirm access for 
the repairs yet because the agency hasn't answered any of my previous 
questions about what exactly will happen during the repairs or what 
solutions they'll provide. From what I understand, my flatmate and I 
will need to leave our rooms during the work, which is quite a big 
decision that affects both our daily lives directly. I don't think it 
makes sense for me to confirm anything when I haven't received any 
information about the details or arrangements.

I'm very sorry if I'm completely misunderstanding how this process 
works. As an international student who has never dealt with anything 
like this before, I realize I probably don't understand what VCAT can 
and cannot help with. I was hoping you might be able to guide me about 
what's reasonable to expect, but I understand if I'm asking for things 
that aren't part of your role.

Should I just accept whatever happens with the repairs and forget about 
the past 70+ days and other problems? I don't want to cause trouble, but 
it doesn't feel right to just forget everything that happened.

I'm quite overwhelmed and honestly don't know what to do about the 
compensation and accommodation issues. Could you please help me 
understand if there are options to address these concerns even if the 
repairs get scheduled?

I hope it's okay to communicate in writing as phone conversations are 
difficult for me with serious matters. I don't have friends or family 
here who understand these problems, so I'm trying to figure everything 
out alone.

Thank you for your patience with me.

Thank you,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil
