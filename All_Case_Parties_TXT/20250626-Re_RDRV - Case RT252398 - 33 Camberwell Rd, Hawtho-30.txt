Hi Matthew,

Thank you for your call earlier.

I have confirmed with the contractor from FIXD Trade Group, the work is 
now scheduled for 7 July 2025.

This is the exact same job scope, which was scheduled for 24 June 2025, 
but no access was granted that day.

The work consists of few stages, and the trade will not be able to send 
me the timeline until he is back to the office tomorrow.

On 7 July 2025, the work will be mould remediation, which is to bring 
the moisture level in the affected bedroom down.

Once the moisture level is at the appropriate level, the damage 
rectification job will be commenced (wall repair & etc).

FIXD Trade Group will need multiple entries for the entire repair work.

Once I have received the timeline from them, I will forward it across so 
that we are all on the same page.

If you need any further details, please feel free to reach out, thanks!

Kind Regards,

Dear Matthew,

I just received your email about closing my case and I'm quite confused. 
I thought getting a repair date was just the beginning of solving my 
problems, not the end.

**The key issues I still need help with are:**
- Compensation for 70+ days of paying full rent for an unusable bedroom
- Where to stay during repairs (the agency hasn't provided any solution 
for this yet)
- This has now affected my studies - my college contacted me this week 
about urgent matters

**I don't understand - does getting a repair date mean I can't ask about 
these other problems anymore?**

Thank you so much for arranging the July 7th repair after you contacted 
them. It's amazing they could suddenly arrange it after saying they 
needed 6-7 business days when I was asking, and I'd already waited over 
two months.

I also wanted to mention that I haven't been able to confirm access for 
the repairs yet because the agency hasn't answered any of my previous 
questions about what exactly will happen during the repairs or what 
solutions they'll provide. From what I understand, my flatmate and I 
will need to leave our rooms during the work, which is quite a big 
decision that affects both our daily lives directly. I don't think it 
makes sense for me to confirm anything when I haven't received any 
information about the details or arrangements.

I'm very sorry if I'm completely misunderstanding how this process 
works. As an international student who has never dealt with anything 
like this before, I realize I probably don't understand what VCAT can 
and cannot help with. I was hoping you might be able to guide me about 
what's reasonable to expect, but I understand if I'm asking for things 
that aren't part of your role.

Should I just accept whatever happens with the repairs and forget about 
the past 70+ days and other problems? I don't want to cause trouble, but 
it doesn't feel right to just forget everything that happened.

I'm quite overwhelmed and honestly don't know what to do about the 
compensation and accommodation issues. Could you please help me 
understand if there are options to address these concerns even if the 
repairs get scheduled?

I hope it's okay to communicate in writing as phone conversations are 
difficult for me with serious matters. I don't have friends or family 
here who understand these problems, so I'm trying to figure everything 
out alone.

Thank you for your patience with me.

Thank you,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

    Hi Matthew,


    Thank you for your email.
    I have spoken with them yesterday morning and they have advised that
    due to their tight schedule, they will have to look into their
    booking and let us know when is the next available date.

    The contractor advised that the next available date should be within
    the next 6-7 business days.


    Since I haven’t received any confirmation, I have just sent another
    email to the OC and the contractor, asking them to provide a date &
    time.

    I will let you know once I have heard back from them.

    Thank you.

    Good afternoon Johnson

    Can you please confirm whether you are able to confirm a time that
    trades will be able to reattend the property. Could you please
    confirm this by close of business today.

    If not I will need to progress this matter to a hearing due to
    timeframes required to list urgent repair applications.

    If an agreement can be reached regarding a timeframe to resolve the
    repair issue this matter can be struck out with a right of
    reinstatement. I have included the renters in this email for reference.
