Good Morning Chawakorn,

I hope you have been well.

Recently, management has made a decision that your rental property will 
be managed by my colleague Sylvia.

I have passed all messages across and have completed adequate handover 
to ensure a smooth transition.

Her email is sylvia.hao@areal.com.au .

She will reach out to you shortly.

Thank you

Kind Regards,

*Subject:* Urgent: Water Damage on Bedroom Wall (Unit 1803)

Dear Hilary,

I’m contacting you regarding an urgent issue in my unit (1803, 243 
Franklin Street). This evening , I noticed a water leak forming on the 
wall above my bed. Within a single day, it spread rapidly — now forming 
a long vertical swelling nearly from ceiling to floor.

I live on the top floor, so this may indicate a ceiling or roof issue. 
I’m concerned it could worsen quickly if not addressed.

Please arrange for a maintenance inspection as soon as possible. I’ve 
attached photos for reference. Let me know if I need to do anything in 
the meantime.

Also, I’d appreciate an update on the status of the bed repair I 
previously reported.

Thanks,

Chawakorn
