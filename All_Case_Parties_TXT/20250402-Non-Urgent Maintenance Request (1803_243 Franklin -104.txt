with Exposed Nails

Dear Property Management Team,


I hope this message finds you well.


I’m writing to report a non-urgent maintenance issue regarding the bed 
frame in my apartment at Unit 1803, 243 Franklin Street, Melbourne VIC 
3000. I’ve attached several photos that show the condition of the bed 
clearly.


Over time, the frame has become structurally compromised due to regular 
usage. I can confidently confirm that there has been no misuse on my 
part. Recently, the issue has worsened—one side of the frame has come 
apart and exposed some nails. Unfortunately, I did sustain a light 
scratch on my leg because of this.


The misalignment also makes it very difficult to use the drawer 
underneath the bed, and the headboard has started to detach slightly as 
well. Items often fall into the gap that’s opened up behind the bed, and 
I’m hesitant to reach in due to the protruding nails.


I understand that other tenants may be facing more urgent problems and 
I’m happy to wait my turn—this is not an emergency. I just wanted to 
make sure it’s on record, and that it can hopefully be addressed when 
it’s suitable for your schedule.


Please feel free to reach out if you need any more details or 
clarification. I appreciate your help and look forward to hearing from 
you when possible.


Warm regards,

Chawakorn Kamnuansil
