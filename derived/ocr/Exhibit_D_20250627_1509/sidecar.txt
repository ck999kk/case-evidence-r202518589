Hi Chawakorn & Matthew,

Good afternoon and hope you all are well.
Quick update, we have served 3 x notice of entry today via registered post (please refer to the files attached).

FIXD will need access to the property at 8AM on 7 July 2025, and for the rest of the week as mentioned in the notice.

This will be the first stage of remediation work, which is to treat the mould and bring the moisture level down.

They might not need to be in the property for the entire 9 hours in the first few days, but they will need access to
check the moisture level in daily basis.

Please be advised that if FIXD is unable to commence the work due to deny of access, the minimum labour charge
applies and the cost will be forwarded to you.

Please let us know if you have any questions about this. Thank you.

Kind Regards,

Johnson Tan

Hi Matthew & Chawakorn,

Good morning and hope you are well.
| have received the reply from FIXD Trade Group — contractor appointed by the OC for the repair.

| have asked for the project timeline, and below is the reply:
Please see below extract from our scope of works sent to Highrise Strata.

The drying process is essential for ensuring all affected building materials return to pre-loss moisture levels. However,
the length of drying time may vary depending on external factors such as weather conditions and moisture content.
FIXD is not responsible for delays in drying due to uncontrollable factors. Monitoring will be conducted daily, and any
necessary adjustments/cost variations will be communicated promptly. FIXD will not be held responsible for any pre-
existing conditions discovered during the course of remediation, including but not limited to structural defects, non-
compliant installations, or prior water damage. Any discoveries will be communicated to the insured, and additional
works may be required outside the scope of this project.

We cannot provide a timeline as per your request due to the existing site constraints and nature of the damages.

Please note, once drying equipment is on-site, it is charged per day. If access is not provided as required by our team,
extra charges may be applicable to the renters for not providing access.

Hi Chawakorn,

Since no access was given on 24 June 2025, the contractor has sent us the attached invoice.
Please advise whether you would like to pay them directly.

Otherwise, the OC will settle with FIXD and on-charge the amount to Lot 1803A, and the rental provider will be
seeking reimbursement from you.

Please advise, thank you.
