Good Morning

My name is Matthew and I am part of the Early Resolution Team at Rental 
Dispute Resolution Victoria (RDRV). I am contacting you regarding your 
recent urgent repairs application.

Our aim is to help people reach an outcome at the earliest point 
possible. As the Resolution Coordinator for your case, I’ll be working 
closely with all parties to guide them through the dispute resolution 
process.

Can you please return my call on 1300-01-737 to discuss your urgent 
repair application before *11:00am 25 June 2025.*

If I do not hear from you by the above time or, if a party is not open 
to negotiating, the case will be progressed to a hearing before a 
tribunal member. If a hearing is scheduled you will receive notification 
of the date and time.

Regards,

*Matthew T.**
*Resolution Coordinator
