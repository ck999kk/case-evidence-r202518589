Dear Hilary,


I’m contacting you regarding an urgent issue in my unit (1803, 243 
Franklin Street). This evening , I noticed a water leak forming on the 
wall above my bed. Within a single day, it spread rapidly — now forming 
a long vertical swelling nearly from ceiling to floor.


I live on the top floor, so this may indicate a ceiling or roof issue. 
I’m concerned it could worsen quickly if not addressed.


Please arrange for a maintenance inspection as soon as possible. I’ve 
attached photos for reference. Let me know if I need to do anything in 
the meantime.


Also, I’d appreciate an update on the status of the bed repair I 
previously reported.


Thanks,

Chawakorn
