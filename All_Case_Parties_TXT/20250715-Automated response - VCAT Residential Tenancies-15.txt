*_How do I submit my evidence to VCAT for the hearing?
_*You will receive an email from VCAT which includes a link enabling you 
to upload your documents directly to VCAT's portal for the member to 
view – the email will be titled: ‘VCAT evidence link’ and will include 
the case file number and rented premises address.

You must submit your evidence at least 3 days prior to your hearing. 
(This may be sooner for urgent cases.)

Click the link to upload and submit your evidence. Ensure you have 
shared these files with the other party. Do not submit any other 
information using this link.

If you have multiple cases in progress, they will each have a separate 
upload link.

The link is active for 6 months from the date it is sent to you. If the 
case is still active after 6 months, you will require a new link.

If you are attending a hearing in person at one of our VCAT venues, you 
must also bring a paper copy of all your documents to the hearing for 
the Member. If you have not provided VCAT with an email address, please 
contact us immediately on renting@courts.vic.gov.au 
<mailto:renting@courts.vic.gov.au> to advise of your email address and 
ask for your evidence link.

If you do not have a copy of the link, please email 
/renting@courts.vic.gov.au <mailto:renting@courts.vic.gov.au>

*_Estimated time to VCAT_
*We prioritise cases that the renting laws say must be heard within a 
certain time, and those we consider urgent. For example, urgent repairs 
are heard within 2 business days, and applications involving personal or 
family violence are heard within 3 business days. It takes about 7 
business days to hear cases about non-urgent repairs. Applications for 
possession due to danger, damage, or disruption are scheduled for 
hearing as soon as possible within 4-6 weeks. Possession applications 
due to unpaid rent are heard in about 6 weeks, and most other 
applications for possession and renewals are heard within 8-10 weeks.
For applications considered urgent under the law 
<https://www.vcat.vic.gov.au/case-types/residential-tenancies/after-you-apply-residential-tenancy-disputes#modal-center1>, 
we contact you by text, phone or email within *24-48 hours*. At an 
urgent hearing, only the urgent issues will be dealt with. Non-urgent 
issues, such as compensation, will be dealt with when there is more time 
at a later hearing.

*_Applications for re-opening (request for a review)_*

If you have submitted a review of an order that allows the Residential 
Rental Provider (Landlord) to purchase a Warrant of Possession, VCAT 
will not issue the Warrant until the review hearing is heard.
If the Warrant has been issued before the review request was made, VCAT 
will make an order placing the Warrant on hold until the review hearing 
is heard. If the Warrant is being executed within 48 hours, you must 
contact our customer service team on 1300 01 8228 (1300 01 VCAT) and 
alert us to your request.

If the Warrant is executed before an order is made placing the Warrant 
on hold, this cannot be reversed.
A copy of this order is sent to all parties and the Police identified on 
the Warrant.
If you or the Police have not received a copy of this order, please 
contact our customer service team on 1300 01 8228 (1300 01 VCAT)

*_If you are being evicted
_*Act now to seek help with alternative housing or get advice on your 
legal rights. If your rental provider has a warrant of possession from 
VCAT, the police can make you leave the property. The police will tell 
you when you need to leave, this may be immediately or they may return 
(usually within 14 days).
If you need help with*crisis or emergency housing *call 1800 825 955. 
This is a 24-hour, state-wide, toll-free service.

VCAT cannot provide legal advice but there are service providers who can 
give legal advice or information free or low cost 
<https://www.vcat.vic.gov.au/what-vcat-does/legal-help-and-advice-services>

If you need someone to talk to, call Lifeline 13 11 14. This is a 
24-hour Crisis Support service.
