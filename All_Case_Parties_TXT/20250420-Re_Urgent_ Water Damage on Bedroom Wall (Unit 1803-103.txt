Dear Hilary and Sylvia,


I hope you are both doing well.


I am writing to kindly follow up regarding the water leakage issue in my 
unit (1803, 243 Franklin Street) which I first reported on 16 April.


Since then, the situation has unfortunately worsened. The water damage 
has expanded across the ceiling and wall, and the swelling and staining 
have become noticeably more severe. I have attached updated photos for 
your reference.


I completely understand that it has been a busy period with the Easter 
holidays. However, given the current condition, I am concerned about the 
potential for further damage and health risks due to prolonged moisture.


May I kindly ask for an update regarding the next steps or any 
arrangements being made?

If a professional inspection could be organised soon, it would be 
greatly appreciated to help prevent any further complications.


Thank you very much for your time and support. I truly appreciate your 
help in resolving this matter.


Kind regards,

Chawakorn Kamnuansil

    Dear Hilary,____

    __ __

    I’m contacting you regarding an urgent issue in my unit (1803, 243
    Franklin Street). This evening , I noticed a water leak forming on
    the wall above my bed. Within a single day, it spread rapidly — now
    forming a long vertical swelling nearly from ceiling to floor.____

    __ __

    I live on the top floor, so this may indicate a ceiling or roof
    issue. I’m concerned it could worsen quickly if not addressed.____

    __ __

    Please arrange for a maintenance inspection as soon as possible.
    I’ve attached photos for reference. Let me know if I need to do
    anything in the meantime.____

    __ __

    Also, I’d appreciate an update on the status of the bed repair I
    previously reported.____

    __ __

    Thanks,____

    Chawakorn____
