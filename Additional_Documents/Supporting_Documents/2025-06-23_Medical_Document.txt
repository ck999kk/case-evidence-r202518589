To Whom it May Concern
Dear,
Re: Mr Chawakorn Kamnuansil
DOB: 14/06/1998
I am writing to you in my professional capacity as the treating doctor for Chawakorn Kamnuansil
who resides at Unit 1803/ 243 Franklin St to address an urgent matter regarding the state of the
rental property.
My patient has been experiencing significant mental health distress due to unresolved water
leakage issues in their home, which have persisted despite multiple requests for repairs. As a
result of these conditions, Chawakorn has been suffering from severe anxiety, difficulty sleeping,
and an overall sense of insecurity, which have led to a marked decline in their mental and
emotional well-being.
As their healthcare provider, I can attest that the chronic exposure to these environmental
stressors is having a detrimental effect on their mental health. The constant noise from dripping
water, the damp and musty air, and the associated health risks are exacerbating their condition.
This is leading to persistent sleep disturbances, anxiety, and an increased sense of vulnerability,
all of which are severely impacting their daily functioning, academic performance, and overall
quality of life.
Given the importance of a safe and secure living environment for both physical and mental health,
I urge you to address these repairs as a matter of priority. Timely intervention in fixing the water
leakage would not only improve the condition of the property but also significantly reduce the
psychological distress my patient is experiencing.
I would greatly appreciate it if you could confirm when the necessary repairs will be scheduled, as
this situation is causing ongoing harm to my patient's well-being.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I trust that you will act swiftly to resolve the
issue in order to support my patient's health and recovery.
Sincerely,
Kind regards,
Dr Rifat Karim
