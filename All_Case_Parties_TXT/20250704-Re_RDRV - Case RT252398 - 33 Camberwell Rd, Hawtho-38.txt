Dear Johnson,

For clarity and to avoid further confusion:

*Where, precisely, are we expected to sleep while industrial dryers 
operate in our only bedroom?
*
For how many days? What specific arrangements have you made to ensure we 
are not left without habitable space?

Let’s be absolutely clear: I never confirmed anything. There is no 
message in which I agreed—because none exists.

It is remarkable that after over two months of delay, the only certainty 
you can offer is the threat of charges if access is denied—yet you 
remain unable to answer the most basic question about where your tenants 
will live.

*If Sylvia chose to claim “confirmation” on my behalf, perhaps the cost 
of this entire situation belongs with her, not me.
*
I look forward to seeing whether you can provide an actual plan rather 
than more excuses.

        To Johnson,

        This email is a formal response to the multiple, legally
        defective 'Notice to Renter' documents issued by Areal Property.
        It outlines your non-compliance and contains a final demand for
        action.

        Let us first establish the facts, based entirely on your own
        actions and documentation:

         1.

            Your Notices Are Invalid: You deliberately marked "NO" on
            your own forms, formally declaring no details were attached.
            This renders them defective under the RTA.

         2.

            You Have Fabricated Evidence: You have repeatedly relied on
            a non-existent "tenant-confirmation" to support your false
            narrative.

         3.

            Abdication of Professional Duty: Your notice directs me to
            seek help from Consumer Affairs Victoria. This is a formal
            admission of your failure to perform your duties as an
            agent, attempting to outsource your responsibilities to me.

        After 70+ days of this conduct, the direct result of your
        failures is that one simple, fundamental question remains
        unanswered. The proposed work is in our only bedroom. Sylvia's
        unprofessional suggestion to "stay at a friend's place" is not a
        solution.

        Therefore, a singular, fundamental question requires your
        immediate attention:

        Where, precisely, are my roommate and I supposed to live while
        our bedroom is a work site?

        To be clear, any refusal of entry based on an unworkable or
        unreasonable plan—similar to the unhelpful suggestions you have
        provided in the past—will not be considered a breach on my part.
        The responsibility to provide a viable, respectful solution
        rests entirely with you. *Consider this carefully*.

        I require your clear, written plan for suitable temporary
        accommodation by 5:00 PM tomorrow, 4 July 2025.

        If you fail to provide this plan by the deadline, I will,
        without further notice, file an urgent application with VCAT and
        a formal complaint with Consumer Affairs Victoria. The complaint
        will detail the entire pattern of conduct outlined in this
        email, including your issuance of defective legal documents,
        fabrication of evidence, and abdication of professional duties.

        Your own documents will form the basis of my submissions.
