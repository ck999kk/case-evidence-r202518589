Dear VCAT Team,

I am writing to provide you with a copy of the VCAT application I lodged 
on *14 July 2025*, relating to the Notice to Vacate issued on *11 July 
2025* for the property:

*Unit 1803, 243 Franklin Street, Melbourne VIC 3000.*

This application challenges the validity of the Notice to Vacate, on the 
basis that it constitutes retaliatory eviction following legitimate 
maintenance complaints.

*Attached to this email you will find:*

  *

    A copy of the VCAT application form (Reference Number: R202518214/00)

  *

    A copy of the Notice to Vacate

This email serves as formal service of the application as required under 
VCAT rules.

Please confirm receipt of this email.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me by email or phone.

Kind regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil
