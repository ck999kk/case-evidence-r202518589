(Regulation 37)
NOTICE TO VACATE TO RENTER OF RENTED PREMISES
INFORMATION FOR RENTERS
1. This is a notice to vacate. It tells you that the residential rental provider (rental provider) wants you to
move out by a certain date. You can find details of this date in clause 10 "Termination date" below.
2. Challenging this notice - You may be able to challenge this Notice at the Victorian Civil and Administrative
Tribunal (VCAT). Reasons to challenge a notice include:
•
•
•
you believe you were given this notice due to unlawful discrimination or because you tried to exercise
your rights as a renter; or
you believe it was not given to you properly; or
you disagree with the reason given or the information in the form is incorrect or incomplete; or
• you have experienced family or personal violence and this caused the behavior listed in the notice to
vacate. In this case, you should apply to VCAT within 30 days after the notice has been given.
Specific timeframes may apply to certain reasons to challenge a notice. You may also challenge the validity of
the notice if the rental provider applies to VCAT for a possession order.
You should seek advice if you are considering challenging a notice to vacate.
3. Unpaid Rent
If you received a notice because you have not paid your rent -
• If you pay all of the unpaid rent on or before the termination date in the notice, this notice has no effect.
• However, this does not apply if you have been given four earlier notices to vacate for rent arrears within
a twelve-month period that starts either on the date your agreement commenced or the anniversary of
that date.
• You can find out more about this type of notice to vacate on the Consumer Affairs Victoria website.
4. Possession orders and warrants - Rental providers must give you the appropriate notice to vacate before they
apply to VCAT for a possession order.
If you do not vacate on the date stated in the notice, the rental provider may apply to VCAT asking for an order
requiring you to leave (a possession order). VCAT will notify you of a hearing date that you can attend. You are
encouraged to attend the hearing.
At the hearing, VCAT decides whether the rental provider was entitled to give you a notice to vacate. VCAT will
make a possession order if it is satisfied that it is reasonable and proportionate to do so. VCAT may consider
whether the notice to vacate was given in response to the act of a person who has subjected you to family or
personal violence. It may also consider whether you can comply with a payment plan for any rental arrears, if
applicable.
VCAT will decide if you must leave the property and on what date that should occur. You may ask for more time
in the property if you will be in hardship. Rental providers cannot personally use force to remove you if you
refuse to leave the property. Only Victoria Police can carry out a forcible eviction, and only when they are acting
on a VCAT order (a warrant for possession).
5. Ending the residential rental agreement earlier - In some cases, you may be able to end the residential rental
agreement (rental agreement) earlier than the termination date in the notice to vacate, if the notice is given for
one of the following reasons:
Repairs or renovations; demolition; change of use of premises; occupation by the rental provider or their family;
the premises are to be sold; the premises are required for a public purpose; the renter no longer meets the
eligibility criteria; or in the case of a fixed term rental agreement, to specify a termination date that is on or after
the date of the end of the initial fixed term of the agreement.
To notify the rental provider, use a Notice of intention to vacate form and provide at least 14 days notice.
6. Seeking advice - If you think you have grounds to challenge a notice to vacate at VCAT you should seek
advice immediately by contacting one of the community legal organisations listed on the Consumer Affairs
Victoria website. For further information visit the renting section of the Consumer Affairs Victoria website at
consumer.vic.gov.au/renting or call 1300 558 181.

specific details.
• VCAT may find a notice to vacate invalid where it does not provide enough details or is not
accompanied by the required documentary evidence.
I am giving you this notice for the following reason:
Section 91ZL Unsafe premises
The premises are unfit for human habitation or have been destroyed totally, or to such an extent as to be
rendered unsafe.
A roof leak from common property caused water to enter the bedroom, resulting in swollen plaster, bubbling
paint, and visible mould. On 23 May 2025, contractor FIXD Trade Group inspected and confirmed the room is
unsafe. Urgent mould remediation is required, including sealing the room, chemical treatment, and drying using
industrial equipment. Drying is expected to take 7 days, followed by reinstatement of plaster and painting, with
the full process taking up to 14 days.
The property will be unsafe and unsuitable to occupy during this time due to noise, equipment use, and health
risks. Despite multiple written requests, the renter has refused access, preventing critical repairs.
This Notice to Vacate is issued to allow urgent works and restore the property to a habitable standard. The
renter is required to vacate by 14 July 2025.
In many cases this notice must be accompanied by documentary evidence. For information on documentary
evidence go to www.consumer.vic.gov.au/ntv
Is documentary evidence attached? Yes
Please provide details of the evidence attached:
