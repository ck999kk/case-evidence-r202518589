*Subject:* Fwd: Non-Urgent Maintenance Request (1803/243 Franklin st) – 
Broken Bed Frame with Exposed Nails

Dear Hilary,

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for your recent 
correspondence and for processing my payment receipt — much appreciated.

I’m writing to follow up on a non-urgent maintenance request I 
originally submitted on 2 April regarding the deteriorating bed frame in 
my apartment (Unit 1803, 243 Franklin Street, Melbourne VIC 3000). As I 
haven’t received a response to that email yet, I wanted to make sure it 
was received and kindly ask for your guidance on the next steps.

To help move things forward without adding to your team’s workload, I’d 
like to propose an alternative solution — if it’s possible under your 
policy, I’d be happy to purchase and install a new bed frame myself, and 
then submit the official receipt for reimbursement under the maintenance 
allowance.

This would:

• Save time coordinating with contractors,

• Allow me to select a frame that suits my needs,

• And reduce the administrative load on your side.

Of course, I would only proceed if it’s approved in advance and would 
comply with any requirements you may have in terms of budget, 
documentation, or supplier type.

If this approach is acceptable, could you please kindly advise:

1. What the maximum reimbursable budget would be?

2. How long it typically takes for reimbursement after submitting receipts?

I’ve forwarded the original email below for your reference, along with 
photos and details.

Thank you very much for your time and understanding. I really appreciate 
your help and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Warm regards,

Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Subject: Non-Urgent Maintenance Request (1803/243 Franklin st) – Broken 
Bed Frame with Exposed Nails
To: <mpm@email.propertyme.com <mailto:mpm@email.propertyme.com>>

Dear Property Management Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

I’m writing to report a non-urgent maintenance issue regarding the bed 
frame in my apartment at Unit 1803, 243 Franklin Street, Melbourne VIC 
3000. I’ve attached several photos that show the condition of the bed 
clearly.

Over time, the frame has become structurally compromised due to regular 
usage. I can confidently confirm that there has been no misuse on my 
part. Recently, the issue has worsened—one side of the frame has come 
apart and exposed some nails. Unfortunately, I did sustain a light 
scratch on my leg because of this.

The misalignment also makes it very difficult to use the drawer 
underneath the bed, and the headboard has started to detach slightly as 
well. Items often fall into the gap that’s opened up behind the bed, and 
I’m hesitant to reach in due to the protruding nails.

I understand that other tenants may be facing more urgent problems and 
I’m happy to wait my turn—this is not an emergency. I just wanted to 
make sure it’s on record, and that it can hopefully be addressed when 
it’s suitable for your schedule.

Please feel free to reach out if you need any more details or 
clarification. I appreciate your help and look forward to hearing from 
you when possible.

Warm regards,

Chawakorn Kamnuansil
