To Johnson,

This email is a formal response to the multiple, legally defective 
'Notice to Renter' documents issued by Areal Property. It outlines your 
non-compliance and contains a final demand for action.

Let us first establish the facts, based entirely on your own actions and 
documentation:

 1.

    Your Notices Are Invalid: You deliberately marked "NO" on your own
    forms, formally declaring no details were attached. This renders
    them defective under the RTA.

 2.

    You Have Fabricated Evidence: You have repeatedly relied on a
    non-existent "tenant-confirmation" to support your false narrative.

 3.

    Abdication of Professional Duty: Your notice directs me to seek help
    from Consumer Affairs Victoria. This is a formal admission of your
    failure to perform your duties as an agent, attempting to outsource
    your responsibilities to me.

After 70+ days of this conduct, the direct result of your failures is 
that one simple, fundamental question remains unanswered. The proposed 
work is in our only bedroom. Sylvia's unprofessional suggestion to "stay 
at a friend's place" is not a solution.

Therefore, a singular, fundamental question requires your immediate 
attention:

Where, precisely, are my roommate and I supposed to live while our 
bedroom is a work site?

To be clear, any refusal of entry based on an unworkable or unreasonable 
plan—similar to the unhelpful suggestions you have provided in the 
past—will not be considered a breach on my part. The responsibility to 
provide a viable, respectful solution rests entirely with you. *Consider 
this carefully*.

I require your clear, written plan for suitable temporary accommodation 
by 5:00 PM tomorrow, 4 July 2025.

If you fail to provide this plan by the deadline, I will, without 
further notice, file an urgent application with VCAT and a formal 
complaint with Consumer Affairs Victoria. The complaint will detail the 
entire pattern of conduct outlined in this email, including your 
issuance of defective legal documents, fabrication of evidence, and 
abdication of professional duties.

Your own documents will form the basis of my submissions.
